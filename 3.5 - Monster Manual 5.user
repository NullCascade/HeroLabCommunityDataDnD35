  <thing id="rBlackwing" name="Blackwing" description="{i}This large skeletal bird&#146;s ragged, ebony wings end in masses of sharp, broken-off bones. Its red eyes seem full of malice and malign intelligence. Talons and a curved beak make up its natural armaments.{/i}\n\nBlackwings are the keen-eyed undead guardians of a fallen civilization.\n\n{b}STRATEGIES AND TACTICS{/b}\nBlackwings spend much of their time patrolling the hills and mountains surrounding their lairs. When they spot prey, they immediately plummet down to attack, using their frightful dive to enter combat.\n\nThey use differing tactics based on the nature of their foes. Blackwings facing flying opponents fight a hit-and-run battle, using their superior speed to divide their enemies before picking off stragglers. Against land-bound opponents, they prefer to hover close to the ground, creating debris clouds using their Hover feat (see page 204). Spellcasting within this cloud requires a DC 16 Concentration check.\n\nUnless dealt significant damage by other opponents, black wings focus their attacks on foes shaken or frightened because of frightful dives. Once they have slain their foes, blackwings carry the bodies back to their lair to search for shiny trinkets. Blackwings fight until destroyed.\n\nMembers of a flock of blackwings fight in concert, keeping as many foes as possible within debris clouds. They use wail of despair at the beginning of the battle, then gang up on one enemy at a time. Only when all enemies appear free of fear does a flock of blackwings bother wailing again.\n\nIf their lair is invaded, blackwings bull rush lightly armored or Small foes out of the cave and down the mountainside. Heavily armored enemies are then cornered and ripped apart. Blackwings mercilessly hunt down fleeing invaders." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rSkulSerp" name="Skull Lord, Serpentir" description="{i}A serpentlike abomination of bone crawls stealthily toward you, both ends crowned by a skull with burning eyes. The creature appears to be composed of a series of linked torsos whose moving ribs propel it forward. Two pairs of taloned skeletal arms reach for you as the monstrosity attacks.{/i}\n\nSerpentirs are unnatural predators, preferring to stalk foes from the shadows rather than face them in a stand-up fight. Their talent for stealth and their speed make them favor quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics.\n\n{b}Strategies and Tactics{/b}\nA serpentir conceals itself from foes whenever possible, shadowing them for hours as it sizes up their abilities and learns their habits. It takes great delight in attacking without warning, using walls, ceilings, and difficult terrain to its advantage. A serpentir attempts to grapple a weak-looking creature, draw that foe into its churning ribs, then retreat. If it has had time to prepare, it takes a preplanned Serpentir escape route that is difficult for foes to follow, such as a steep mine shaft or a rubble-filled corridor. If this tactic proves successful, the serpentir continues to stalk the group, attacking in the same way at the next opportunity.\n\nIf cornered or forced to fight, a serpentir does not shy away from battle. It moves quickly as one move action, then brings five claw attacks to bear against individual targets, using its remaining standard and full-round actions. A cornered serpentir faced with only a single creature always attempts to grapple and draw that foe into its churning ribs.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nA serpentir is born with a hunger it can never satisfy. Compelled to devour living prey, these creatures are then forced to watch their mangled meals drop through empty ribs, leaving them eternally ravenous.\n\nThe skull lords created serpentirs, but their uncontrollable urge for slaughter has led a lot of these creatures to escape their servitude. Necromancers have since learned the art of creating these menaces, and chaotic necromantic cabals spawn such dangerous predators as implements of mindless terror.\n\n{b}Environment{/b}: Serpentirs favor underground environments, and they are spawned with an innate understanding of the subterranean world. Their urge to feed on the living leads a large number of free serpentirs to seek hunting grounds near humanoid settlements. Mines are a favored habitat, as are the sewer tunnels beneath human cities. Graveyards riddled with catacombs, shantytowns built around twisting alleyways, and abandoned castles make good serpentir lairs.\n\n{b}Typical Physical Characteristics{/b}: A serpentir consists of a number of skeletal torsos linked together spine to spine, forming a serpentlike mass of twisting ribs and vertebrae some 15 feet long and weighing 300 pounds. At each end, the creature bears a skull and two long arms with clawed hands. The prehensile ribs of a serpentir click softly as they undulate, shifting like the myriad legs of a centipede. Bits of decaying flesh and shreds of rotten cloth cling to the creature&#146;s jagged bones, remnants of its previous unsatisfying meals." compset="Race">

You hear the creak of twisting wood as it strides forward, thick limbs thrashing the ground as they reach for you.{/I}\n\nThose who live their lives in the service of a dryad become changed over time, becoming one with the natural world of their mistress. In the end, they are transformed into verdant reavers, losing all memory of their former lives as they become thralls of the fey.\n\n{b}STRATEGIES AND TACTICS{/b}\nA verdant reaver typically begins combat with a Powerful Charge to measure a foe&#146;s relative strength. Against weaker melee threats or creatures that have reach, a verdant reaver tries to remain adjacent to make use of its verdant rend ability. Foes that make multiple attacks in melee are instead kept 5 feet away, forcing them to move into the area of the reaver&#146;s verdant growth if they wish to attack. Since this movement cannot be accomplished with merely a 5-foot step, such foes cannot make a full attack. Additionally, they might provoke an attack of opportunity when they move through the verdant reaver&#146;s threatened area.\n\n{b}ECOLOGY{/b}\nWhen a dryad {i}charms{/i} a humanoid creature to her service, that creature slowly begins to absorb the essence of his fey mistress and the forest she defends. The life of a dryad&#146;s thrall is a harsh one. Such creatures experience all the wildness of the weather and the changing of the seasons, and they are forced to scramble for shelter, warmth, and food. Thralls must also survive the tasks their dryads set for them, including defending the dryad from threats, delivering messages to other dryads in the area, and searching through the forest for shiny stones, weathered wood, and other items that strike the dryad&#146;s fancy. \n\nIf a humanoid survives this treatment for a year and a day (and assuming the dryad does not simply grow bored and dismiss him), he awakens to find himself rooted to the ground. His transformation into a plant creature takes place over the course of that day. The creature&#146;s hair falls out, and his skin takes on the texture of bark. The thrall&#146;s dryad mistress might attempt to comfort him during this distressing and painful process. Attempting to cut or tear the creature from the ground kills it instantly, but a {i}remove disease{/i} or {i}remove curse{/i} spell frees the thrall from the transformation process.\n\nIf not freed before sundown, the thrall becomes a verdant reaver, forgetting nearly all its past life and possessing undying loyalty to the dryad who created it. \n\nEvil and neutral dryads delight in creating verdant reaver servants, seeking out those hapless souls who pass too close to their domains. Good dryads rarely make verdant reavers intentionally, sometimes discovering the process only after a romantic attraction to a humanoid turns to dark possessiveness. Thereafter, a good dryad creates a verdant reaver only if she believes a thrall is worthy of the punishment.\n\nFreeing a thrall from a dryad can be a simple matter of dispelling the {i}charm{/i} effect that binds it, but such creatures can also be easily freed while they sleep. A dryad&#146;s {i}charm person{/i} spell-like ability normally lasts 6 hours and can be used three times per day. This leaves a 6-hour period during which the thrall is free of the dryad&#146;s {i}charm{/i}. Dryads typically use {i}suggestion{/i} to order the thrall to sleep and take shelter until morning, whereupon the dryad can renew her {i}charm{/i}. If approached and awakened during this period, a thrall might be easily convinced to escape its servitude.\n\n{b}Environment{/b}: Verdant reavers live primarily in the temperate forests where dryads are found. However, those that have broken with or been dismissed by their dryad mistresses wander far afi eld in search of another mistress to obey and protect.\n\nIf properly commanded and treated well, a verdant reaver might follow a new mistress even out of its normal forest environment. Rumors sometimes tell of these creatures living entirely underground as the servants of strange druid sects.\n\n{b}Typical Physical Characteristics{/b}: Weighing 600 to 1,000 pounds, verdant reavers resemble animated fallen logs or driftwood more than living plants. They stand 12 to 15 feet tall, but their hunched posture makes them appear slightly shorter." compset="Race">

Similar creatures follow it, seemingly drawing strength from their proximity to one another.{/i}\n\nCarnage demons exist only to destroy, and they revel in the ruin they wreak.\n\n{b}Strategies and Tactics{/b}\nDespite having massive claws, which they use to climb, carnage demons prefer to pummel their opponents. A lone carnage demon is still a brutal adversary, but such a loner flees if reduced to half of its full normal hit points or fewer. All carnage demons prefer to fight alongside individuals of their kind, venting their hatred on all other creatures.\n\nIn a group, carnage demons remain close to each other as they attack. Each one lets its fury rather than any sense of tactics dictate where its next attack is aimed, usually pounding whoever damaged it the most during the previous round. If fighting opponents that have no silvered weapons, carnage demons gladly provoke attacks of opportunity to get in among their enemies, quickly overwhelming softer targets such as spellcasters.\n\nCarnage demons are a danger to all creatures that aren&#146;t carnage demons. A carnage demon that has succumbed to its destructive appetite attacks nearby allies for no better reason than being unable to move to an enemy and attack it during the current round.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nCarnage demons are the brutes among the lesser fiends of the Abyss. They are the destructive manifestation of chaos, spurred on by a burning desire to batter other creatures in the bloodiest and most painful ways possible. Although they are similar in power to dretches, they don&#146;t share the aimlessness of those dull fiends. Instead, carnage demons are filled with the singular purpose of pure destruction.\n\nSome consider carnage demons to be a forced evolution of the pathetic dretches, the product of a demon lord&#146;s attempt to create a more useful lesser demon. This theory gains some credence from the fact that, unlike most demons, carnage demons are not tanar&#146;ri. Their vulnerability to silvered weapons suggests they might have been created using materials from or related to devils.\n\n{b}Environment{/b}: Carnage demons, like most demons, are extraplanar creatures that are native to the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. Mobs of carnage demons can be found anywhere on that plane. They are always eager to spread destruction and slaughter, so they use any portal or gate they encounter, having no concern for where it might lead. As such, carnage demons can also be found near any place that harbors a gateway to the Abyss.\n\n{b}Typical Physical Characteristics{/b}: A carnage demon has a powerful humanoid build that borders on apelike, with long arms hanging nearly to the ground. Those arms end in forearms the size of tree trunks, as well as stubby hands with thick fingers and claws. The fiend&#146;s fanged mouth takes up most of its face, and its head seems slightly smaller than is proportional for its body.\n\nCarnage demons have skin that ranges from a bloody crimson to a darker red-brown. A typical carnage demon stands nearly 6 feet tall and weighs over 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Society{/b}\nThe carnage demon&#146;s particular purpose of mad destruction doesn&#146;t lend itself to fitting into any organized society, even a demonic one. Its dim intellect allows it to be easily enticed\nby the promise of devastation. In many cases, more powerful fiends, especially the more cunning demons such as adarus or succubi, loosely control groups of carnage demons.\n\nIn the vast hordes of fiendish armies that battle on the Lower Planes, demonic generals send mobs of carnage demons behind the first waves of dretches, since dretches are more likely to rush toward the enemy if the threat of death at the fists of carnage demons is spurring them onward. Carnage demons are perfect shock troops&#151;their savagery brings fear, death, and confusion to the opposing forces." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rDemonMand" name="Demonthorn Mandrake" description="{i}Thorny red stalks grow out of a cluster of crimson roots that twitch and shudder. Star-shaped leaves ring the plant around a large, spiny seedpod at its heart. Two bristly vines sprout from either side of this pod.{/i}\n\n{b}STRATEGIES AND TACTICS{/b}\nIf used as a guardian, a demonthorn mandrake hides on a ceiling or wall, waiting for prey. Once combat begins, a demonthorn mandrake spits spore pods until all its enemies are infested with thorns, then it closes to engage in melee. In melee combat, a demonthorn mandrake uses its tangle root ability to prevent escape and thrashes opponents with slams.\n\nIn groups, demonthorn mandrakes fire spore pods to hit as many creatures as possible with little or no overlap. Then, groups of the plants single out enemies to attack, first targeting those who are suffering from spore pod thorns. Demonthorn mandrakes rarely retreat, having little sense of self-preservation.\n\n{b}ECOLOGY{/b}\nDemonthorn mandrakes do not need water or light to live &#151; they derive nourishment from the flesh of their victims. If starved of this food source for more than a month, a plant goes dormant and can continue to live for years without sustenance before finally withering and dying. A demonthorn mandrake&#146;s roots are extremely sensitive, allowing it to sense nearby creatures that are touching the ground even when it is dormant.\n\nDemonthorn mandrakes reproduce by using other living creatures as hosts. Medium or larger victims slain by mandrake spore pod thorns play host to a sapling plant, which grows to maturity in 1d4 hours, consuming most of the host creature&#146;s blood and flesh to fuel the process.\n\n{b}Environment{/b}: Demonthorn mandrakes are most commonly found on the Lower Planes, including the Abyss, the Nine Hells, and Gehenna. In these places, demonthorn mandrakes congregate in large groups.\n\nOn the Material Plane, demonthorn mandrakes are found guarding a specific place, under the direct control of a conjurer who called them, or wandering about, free to do as they please. Uncontrolled mandrakes hide in secluded places such as sewers, caverns, or forest glades, waiting for unsuspecting victims to wander by.\n\n{b}Typical Physical Characteristics{/b}: An average demonthorn mandrake stands about 8 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. When rooted in place and motionless, demonthorn mandrakes appear more like odd plants than creatures. When it is moving, a demon thorn mandrake&#146;s roots extend and retract at a rapid pace, pulling the body of the plant along.\n\n{b}SOCIETY{/b}\nDemonthorn mandrakes get along well with others of their kind unless the group has not fed for some time, in which case they fight over every last scrap of food. Such battles rarely turn deadly.\n\nAs plant creatures, demonthorn mandrakes do not form societies, but a great demonthorn mandrake, the Mother Seed, exists somewhere in a particularly verdant locale in the Abyss. This Mother Seed is larger than any other demon thorn mandrake, and it possesses a cruel and cunning intellect. It is an authority that other demonthorn mandrakes obey without hesitation." compset="Race">
