  <thing id="tmHalfFey" name="Half-Fey" description="{i}{b}&quot;Half-fey&quot;{/b}{/i} is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature&#146;s type changes to {b}fey.{/b} It uses all the base creature&#146;s statistics and special abilities except as noted.\n\n{b}Speed:{/b} All half-fey have butterflylike wings unless the base creature has wings already.  A half-fey that did not already have wings gains a fly speed equal to twice the base creature&#146;s fastest mode of movement, with good maneuverability.\n\n{b}Special Attacks:{/b} A half-fey with Wisdom or Charisma of 8 or higher (after the ability score adjustments noted below) gains spell-like abilities, using its Hit Dice as its caster level.\n\nThe table below lists the abilities available. These abilities are cumulative; a half-fey with 3 HD can use the abilities on the 1&#150;2 HD row on the table as well as those on the 3&#150;4 HD row. When a half-fey gets a choice between two abilities (such as faerie fire or glitterdust at 1&#150;2 HD), it can choose anew between these abilities each day.\n\n{b}HD       Abilities{/b}\n1&#150;2      Charm person at will, hypnotism 1/day, faerie fire or glitterdust 1/day\n3&#150;4       Detect law 3/day, sleep or enthrall 1/day\n5&#150;6       Protection from law 3/day, Tasha&#146;a hideous laughter or suggestion 1/day\n7&#150;8       Confusion or emotion 1/day\n9&#150;10    Eyebite or lesser geas 1/day\n11&#150;12    Dominate person or hold monster 1/day\n13&#150;14   Mass invisibility 1/day\n15&#150;16   Geas/quest or mass suggestion 1/day\n17&#150;18   Insanity or mass charm 1/day\n19+       Otto&#146;s irresistible dance 1/day\n\nThe magical nature of fey allows them to crossbreed with virtually any other creature. The offspring of the resulting unions, half-fey, are enigmatic and freespirited beings.\n\nFey are deeply curious about other creatures, spending a great deal of time watching their behavior.\n\nSometimes they have dalliances with a nonfey, often forgetting that there are consequences for their actions.  The progeny from these moments of passion are either completely ignored by the fey parent or utterly embraced, with the parent teaching it secrets that only the fey can know.\n\nHalf-fey vary wildly in their appearance, and no two are exactly alike.  Half-fey can either be beautiful and comely, with exaggerated and chiseled features, or misshapen and troll-like.  Sometimes it is apparent from birth that a child is not normal, but other times it takes several years for odd features to emerge.\n\nRegardless of what form they take, half-fey are always charismatic and intriguing to gaze upon.  They always have at least one or more distinctive attribute, such as wings, jeweled or knotty skin, or hair made of flowers.\n\nHalf-fey never truly fit into any mortal society, being considered alien and strange beyond compare.  Because of their ability to charm and lay curses, some half-fey are persecuted by superstitious populations.  However, half-fey are usually accepted to some degree among fey, who look past superficial aspects such as appearance.\n\nGood half-fey are usually devoted, if capricious, defenders of the wilderness and do their best to keep it unspoiled.  Evil half-fey are malicious, petty, vindictive, and sadistic, delighting in the chaos and mayhem that they can cause.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Fiend Folio" compset="Template" summary="The creature gains the half-fey template." uniqueness="unique">

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\n\n{i}1st Round{/i}: Presence or absence of law.\n{i}2nd Round{/i}: Number of lawful auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent law aura present.  If you are of chaotic alignment, and the strongest lawful aura&#146;s power is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura&#146;s source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.\n{i}3rd Round{/i}: The power and location of each aura.

The class description will indicate whether this applies.\n\n{i}Aura Power{/i}: A lawful aura&#146;s power depends on the type of lawful creature or object that you&#146;re detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the accompanying table.  If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.\n\nFor example, as indicated on the table, an lawful outsider with 12 HD has an overwhelming aura of law.  A good cleric who casts this spell and directs it at the location of such a creature for longer than 1 round loses the spell and is stunned for 1 round if his character level is 6th or lower.\n\n{i}Lingering Aura{/i}: A lawful aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item).   If {i}detect law{/i} is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).  How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:\n\n{b}Duration of\nOriginal Strength Lingering Aura{/b}\nFaint 1d6 rounds\nModerate 1d6 minutes\nStrong 1d6&#215;10 minutes\nOverwhelming 1d6 days\n\nAnimals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not law, and as such this spell does not detect them.\n\nEach round, you can turn to detect law in a new area.  The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it." compset="Special" summary="3/day, Detect Law">

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\n\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves.  Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by lawful creatures.\n\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a {i}magic jar{/i} attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as {i}dominate person{/i}).  The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the {i}protection from law{/i} effect.  If the {i}protection from law{/i} effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature.  Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.  This second effect works regardless of alignment.\n\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures.  This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect.  The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.  Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature." compset="Special" summary="3/day, +2 to AC and saves, counter m-c, hedge out elementals and outsiders.">
