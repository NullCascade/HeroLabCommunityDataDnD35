  <thing id="rGoliath" name="Goliath" description="Goliaths are massive creatures unafraid of throwing their weight around in a fight. Highly competitive, these strong nomads can prove to be powerful allies and welcome additions to any adventuring party.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Goliaths are known for their almost foolhardy daring. In their mountain homes, they leap from precipice to precipice, heedless of the fatal consequences of a misstep. They place great stock in clan and family; life in the mountains teaches even the youngest goliath to rely completely on his fellows for a hand across a crevasse. Because most goliaths are hunter-gatherers, they tend to be inquisitive, always curious about whether better hunting lies over the next ridge or a good water source can be found in the next canyon.\n\nGoliaths are completely unsympathetic toward tribe members who can&#146;t contribute to the well-being of the tribe anymore&#151;an attitude reinforced by social structures. Old, sick, and otherwise infirm goliaths are exiled from their clans, never to return.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: A typical goliath is larger than the largest half-orc. Most stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Unlike with most other races, there is no appreciable difference in height or weight between male and female goliaths.\n\nGoliaths have gray skin, mottled with dark and light patches that goliath shamans say hint at a particular goliath&#146;s fate. Lithoderms&#151;coin-sized bone-and-skin growths as hard as pebbles&#151;speckle their arms, shoulders, and torso. Their skulls have a jutting eyebrow ridge, wide jaw, and occasional lithoderms as well. Female goliaths have dark hair on their heads, grown to great length and always kept braided. Male goliaths generally have hair only on their limbs. Goliaths&#146; eyes are a brilliant blue or green, and they often seem to glow a little from underneath their furrowed brows.\n\nBecause their skin mottling has cultural significance, goliaths generally dress as lightly as possible, displaying their skin patterns for all to see. For the same reason, few goliaths would willingly get a tattoo&#151;to draw on one&#146;s skin is tantamount to trying to rewrite one&#146;s fate. Goliaths instead decorate themselves with jewelry, often sporting ear, nose, or brow rings. A goliath&#146;s lithoderms are also common places to embed a gem or two, since they have few nerve endings and stand out on the goliath&#146;s body already.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: When encountered in the mountains, goliaths are outwardly friendly to anyone who doesn&#146;t threaten the tribe and can keep up with them as they climb from peak to peak. Humans who brave the mountains&#151;rangers and druids, most often&#151;can often earn a tasty meal by helping a team of goliath hunters.\n\nGoliaths hold dwarves in particularly high regard, wishing their tribes had the dwarven aptitude for weapon crafting. Some of the bravest goliaths climb down into the tunnels and natural caverns under a mountain, seeking a dwarf community to trade with.\n\nThe smaller-than-human races are regarded as curiosities, but many a nimble-climbing gnome or halfl ing has earned respect by beating a goliath in a race up a cliff. Goliaths view the extended life span of an elf as vaguely frightening, finding it hard to imagine a person who could have known one&#146;s great-great grandfather.\n\nA goliath tribe&#146;s attitude toward any nearby giants varies widely. Some tribes eagerly trade with giants; the giants&#146; weapons aren&#146;t up to dwarven standards, but they are made in larger sizes (which goliaths greatly prefer). However, giants have a bad habit of trying to turn goliaths into their slaves, using them for menial tasks they&#146;re too big or too lazy to do themselves. Confl ict inevitably ensues, and soon either the giants are dead, the goliaths have fled, or the goliaths are chained up as slaves to a giant-lord.\n\nGoliaths tend to hold goblinoids and orcs (including half orcs) at arm&#146;s length, noting that the &#147;downlanders&#148; they trade with regard such races as troublemakers. But because goblinoids rarely stray into the high mountains, they are usually someone else&#146;s trouble, so goliaths don&#146;t bear them any actual malice.\n\n{b}Goliath Lands{/b}: Because they don&#146;t support large-scale agriculture or extensive settlements, the mountain ranges where goliaths live are home to few other intelligent races. Most tribes of goliaths wander from peak to peak, tending their goat flocks and foraging for alpine roots and tubers. Typically, a tribe sets up a temporary village in an alpine meadow and remains there for a month or two, then moves on when the season changes or better hunting can be found elsewhere. Larger tribes tend to follow a similar trail from year to year, retreating to lower elevations in midwinter and when they need to trade, then ascending to the highest peaks once the snow melts.\n\nSome goliaths live at lower altitudes among humans or other races, most often because their tribe exiled them after a crime, dispute, or injury. Many a folk tale features a forlorn goliath working as a farmhand after a failed courtship in the mountains.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Kavaki the Ram-Lord is the primary deity of the goliaths (see the Religion section later in this chapter). As the Chief of All Chiefs, he watches over the goliaths and their mountain homes. His clerics say that Kavaki created the goliaths when he found a bush bearing gems in place of fruit growing atop the highest mountain peak in the world. When Kavaki plucked gems from the bush, those gems became the first tribe of goliaths. Kavaki instructs his followers to seek out the hidden bounty of the mountains and keep the tribe safe from harm.\n\n{b}Language{/b}: For millennia, the goliaths have had only a spoken tongue, Gol-Kaa, which has only thirteen phonetic elements: a, e, g, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, u, th, and v. Recently, the goliaths have picked up the alphabet of the Dwarven language, though the concept of a written language hasn&#146;t spread to all the tribes yet. Those tribes that have learned the Dwarven alphabet are busily transcribing the goliaths&#146; vast oral tradition into carvings, cave paintings, and even books.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn&#146;s mother and father, a nickname or honorific assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. The birth name tends to be short&#151;often only a syllable or two&#151;but the clan names often have five syllables or more and always end in a vowel.\n\nThe honorific isn&#146;t a traditional name so much as it is a descriptive nickname, often a two-part sobriquet. The honorific can change at the whim of the tribal chief, whether because a particular goliath did something useful for the tribe (earning an honorific such as &#147;Highclimber&#148; or &#147;Nighthunter&#148;) or as punishment for failure (a middle name such as &#147;Latesleeper&#148; or &#147;Wanderslost&#148;). Goliaths who have been exiled from their tribe generally carry a middle name that reflects their status, such as &#147;Solitary&#148; or &#147;Kinless.&#148; Some specific roles within the tribe, such as lorekeeper or shaman (described in the Society and Culture section later in this chapter), have honorifics attached to them as well.\n\nWhen introducing themselves for the first time, goliaths always use the first name/honorific/family name construction, translating the honorific into the listener&#146;s language if possible. Thereafter, they refer to themselves and each other by the honorific alone. Goliaths traveling among other races sometimes assign honorifics to their comrades rather than use their given names.\n\n{b}Male Names{/b}: Aukan, Eglath, Gauthak, Ilikan, Keothi, Lo-Kag, Maveith, Meavoi, Thotham, Vimak.\n\n{b}Female Names{/b}: Gae-Al, Kuori, Manneo, Nalla, Orilo, Paavu, Pethani, Thalai, Uthal, Vaunea.\n\n{b}Honorifics{/b}: Bearkiller, Dawncaller (see Chapter 5 for details on this prestige class), Fearless, Flintfinder, Horncarver, Keeneye, Lonehunter, Longleaper, Rootsmasher, Skywatcher, Steadyhand, Threadtwister, Twice-Orphaned, Twistedlimb, Wordpainter.\n\n{b}Family Names{/b}: Anakalathai, Elanithino, Gathakanathi, Kalagiano, Katho-Olavi, Kolae-Gileana, Ogolakanu, Thuliaga, Thunukalathi, Vaimei-Laga.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Traditionally, the only goliaths to become adventurers are those exiled (voluntarily or other wise) from the goliath tribes high in the mountains. However, since some goliath tribes spend more time with &#147;downlanders,&#148; especially the dwarves, it&#146;s becoming more common for a tribe to send a particularly competent goliath on a mission that aids the tribe or goliaths in general. Once they descend from their mountain homes, most goliaths find the lowlands fascinating, although they are generally on their guard against &#147;downland tricksters.&#148; The same wanderlust that keeps goliath tribes moving often keeps a lone goliath among humans for far longer than he originally intended." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rGnoChaos" name="Gnome, Chaos" description="Infused with the spirit of chaos, these gnomes are energetic, flamboyant, and charismatic. They exude a restless, inspirational energy and seldom rest. They also possess uncanny luck and have great talent as sorcerers. Colorful cousins of standard gnomes, they are adventurous; even the most staid among them is prone to wander. Although commonly referred to as chaos gnomes, these precocious humanoids also call themselves &#147;imago&#148; (singular and plural).\n\nAlthough some find chaos gnomes&#146; energy and recklessness off-putting, none doubt their power as sorcerers. With their powerful racial ability to bring a touch of chaos to their spellcasting, spellcasting imago often become known as chaos mystics.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Chaos gnomes find probability, chance, and randomness extremely fascinating. Although many individuals of other races consider them slightly mad, chaos gnomes can at times be brilliant, making intuitive leaps to accurate conclusions that might elude the brightest thinkers of other races. They have a great sense of humor, finding amusement in many aspects of life. Unlike other gnomes, however, chaos gnomes are seldom tricksters or pranksters.\n\nChaos gnomes have a great love of arcane magic, and they often develop sorcerous talents. Although they appreciate divine magic for its power and utility, they rarely remain devoted to one deity or philosophy long enough to develop significant divine spellcasting abilities.\n\nMany find these free-spirited gnomes engaging, and more serious or stoic individuals often form great friendships with chaos gnomes. Chaos gnomes enjoy such relationships as well, finding a natural foil for their own chaotic nature in the serious demeanors of their friends.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: Chaos gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall, much like other gnomes. They have the same slight build and trim appearance that other gnomes favor, but their coloring differs wildly. Chaos gnomes have bright red, blue, green, or violet eyes, and their eyes change in hue and brightness depending on their mood&#151;from bright red when angry or excited to dull green or blue when bored or disappointed. They have similarly bright hair color, ranging from vivid red to blond.\n\nChaos gnomes favor bright colors in their clothing, particularly reds and oranges. They decorate their clothing with seemingly random bead patterns.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Chaos gnomes get along well with members of most races, but they find it especially easy to relate to other gnomes. They are at ease with the free-spirited elves, and they enjoy the halflings&#146; nomadic lifestyle. Dwarves have a difficult time getting along with chaos gnomes. Dwarves respect other gnomes for their inventiveness and skill with mechanical objects, but chaos gnomes are simply too likely to break rules, laws, or customs for dwarves to tolerate them for long. Perhaps surprisingly, half-orcs get along well with chaos gnomes. The gnomes are seldom concerned with a half-orc&#146;s parentage, so their communities seem particularly accommodating and open to half-orcs who have had difficulty finding acceptance by other races.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: Chaos gnomes, as their name suggests, are naturally inclined toward chaos. Although they are flighty even by the standards of other gnomes, they are goodhearted like most of their kindred.\n\nChaos gnomes value freedom, which is the one cause or ideal that can always hold their attention.\n\n{b}Chaos Gnome Lands{/b}: Chaos gnomes thrive anywhere, and since they are not numerous, they often dwell with or near other gnomes for protection. Chaos gnomes are not the wanderers that halflings are, but neither are their communities as permanent as those of most other races. Typically, a few chaos gnome families decide to settle in a pleasant area and begin building a community. Within a few years, the area will be a small but bustling chaos gnome town. After about a decade, though, the gnomes begin to move on, and within two or three years thereafter, the area is likely devoid of chaos gnome inhabitants.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Chaos gnomes rarely take a serious religious stance&#151;they join a church for as long as it suits their fancy and then move to another when worship grows dull or troublesome. Chaos gnomes are more serious about the worship of Garl Glittergold than of any other deity, but even he cannot hold their attention or devotion for long.\n\n{b}Language{/b}: Chaos gnomes speak Gnome. They enjoy learning different languages, and they often pull expressions and words from other languages into their own.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: Chaos gnomes love names, and most have at least a half dozen. A chaos gnome is given a name by her parents, but she usually uses it only for the first ten years or so of her life. By that time, a chaos gnome usually feels ready to pick her own name. This first name choice is as serious a tradition as any that exists in chaos gnome culture, and an individual uses this name for up to six or seven years before changing it again. After this second name change, a chaos gnome chooses a new name whenever she feels so inclined, many times just adopting a word or words that she likes.\n\n{i}Male Names{/i}: Aidien, Doolian, Chainion, Pellia, Rookinoniak, Zingnoff.\n{i}Female Names{/i}: Gonnynock, Pella, Tarralin, Zernaelian.\n{i}Family Names{/i}: Chebwith, Kalliess, Nornock, Parrington, Smothings.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Like their more common kindred, chaos gnomes are curious and impulsive. Most chaos gnomes adventure to see the world. Their nearly insatiable love of new and different sights and experiences drives many chaos gnomes to wander for a good portion of their youth. Older chaos gnomes are even likely to accompany their children on their first significant travels." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rDwfDream" name="Dwarf, Dream" description="Dream dwarves feel the hills slumber beneath them. They see the world as a resting giant of inestimable power, and they are caught in the dreaming. While other dwarves shape metal and stone, dream dwarves contemplate and meditate. Wise and cautious, they understand nature in a way at once similar to and wholly alien to the understanding of druids and shamans of other races.\n\nDream dwarves share a sort of collective subconscious with the world around them, a phenomenon they call the earth dream. The earth dream shapes many aspects of a dream dwarf&#146;s life, and no discussion of dream dwarves can be complete without at least some understanding of the earth dream. The earth dream is a powerful force, and members of other races can occasionally feel its pull and become earth dreamers (see page 110).\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Dream dwarves have little of the natural craftsmanship of other dwarves, and they instead spend many hours in somber contemplation of the earth dream. They are inquisitive, and they seek to supplement the information and wisdom they gain from the earth dream with personal experience. To those who don&#146;t know them well, dream dwarves can seem shy or wary, but in truth they are merely reserved; they are more likely to utter one carefully chosen phrase than engage in a prolonged discussion.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: Dream dwarves stand about 4 feet tall and weigh about 10 to 15 pounds less than a typical dwarf. Their skin color ranges from dark gray to deep brown, and their hair is dark brown or black. They have pale eyes, usually green or blue in color but with the occasional lavender or pale red. Dream dwarves usually decorate their clothing with abstract symbols that represent important personal experiences within the earth dream.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Dream dwarves get along well with other dwarves, who look up to them as shamans and prophets. They also get along well with gnomes, who share their love of the earth, and they even enjoy the company of halflings and elves. They are friendly with druids of any race, sharing the class&#146;s love of nature and natural power. Their silent and mystical demeanor can cause humans, half elves, and half-orcs to think dream dwarves a little strange, but rarely causes significant problems in relationships with members of these races.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: Dream dwarves are most often neutral good. They share a bond with the earth and the earth dream, and this bond helps them see the power and energy inherent in a peaceful life. As a result, most dream dwarves remain kind and good-hearted even through adversity, and they value a balance between law and chaos.\n\n{b}Dream Dwarf Lands{/b}: Dream dwarves almost always build their homes within or near those of other dwarves, and many members of other races don&#146;t even realize that dream dwarves are a separate subrace. Their homes are often underground, embodying their love of the earth. Occasionally, dream dwarves form small, secluded monasteries high up on a mountainside in an effort to become closer to the earth dream.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Although dream dwarves pay homage to Moradin and the rest of the dwarf pantheon, their primary deity is the earth itself, as expressed by the collective experience that dream dwarves call the earth dream.\n\n{b}Language{/b}: Dream dwarves speak Dwarven.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: Dream dwarves place great significance on their names, believing that even the most common version of a name carries power. Their names are likely to change over time, as they incorporate new syllables or words into their names. Dream dwarves believe that they find these words and syllables within the depths of the earth dream, and they incorporate them into their identities out of reverence and to show that they understand the power of the earth.\n\nIt is quite likely for a dream dwarf&#146;s name to change or grow longer after he goes through a particularly harrowing or dangerous experience; as such, it&#146;s usually true that an accomplished dream dwarf adventurer has a long, intricate name that recalls his greatest exploits.\n\n{i}Male Names{/i}: Bren-Iol, Bollinak, Car-Innul, Derinar, Harar, Malanath.\n{i}Female Names{/i}: Allalia, Assanae, Giallin, Kula-Tai, Mala, Shelbath.\nClan {b}Names{/b}: Brekaran, Esstranak, Penathan, Quwerthena, Skarnath.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Dream dwarf adventurers seek the wisdom that comes from personal experience. Some, driven by the earth dream&#146;s urgings, wander to find more of what they&#146;ve seen in the dream. Others seek to escape the dream and their people&#146;s involvement in it, traveling to other lands to be rid of its pull. Most however, travel and adventure to better understand the parts of the earth dream that they can sense, to experience the dream in other places, and to broaden their own understanding of the world." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rFeralGarg" name="Feral Gargun" description="A small offshoot of the goliath race, feral garguns tear their livelihood out of the frigid northern regions with tooth and claw. Feral garguns derive from goliath and giant parentage. These large, savage humanoids fight in quick, furious bursts of energy. In the barren areas of the north, there is little room for mercy, and the feral garguns have had to learn to be aggressive just to survive.\n\nEven more than their goliath kindred, feral garguns find cities and the trappings of civilization confusing and intimidating. Although individual feral garguns have found ways to adapt to the cities and villages of other races, the majority prefers the simple, nomadic lifestyle of the far north.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Fierce, quick-tempered warriors, feral garguns usually assume that the strongest individual is the leader, and they usually settle disagreements with some nonlethal test of strength. Despite this outward ferocity, feral garguns have a deep sense of personal honor and place a great deal of importance on self-reliance.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: A typical feral gargun is as big as a goliath and larger than the largest half-orc. Most stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. As with their goliath kindred, there is no appreciable difference in height or weight between male and female feral garguns.\n\nFeral garguns are covered in smooth, thick fur. This fur ranges in color from white to light gray to dark brown. Although their bodies are humanoid in shape, the faces of feral garguns are similar to those of bears, and they have longer, narrower faces than other humanoids.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Most feral garguns have little to no interaction with other humanoid races, so when they do interact, they remain curious and polite, at least by their standards. They get along well with goliaths, who trade the feral garguns metal weapons and armor when they have them to spare. Feral garguns also enjoy the company of halflings, valuing their success at maintaining a nomadic lifestyle. Feral garguns some times see halflings as mentor figures because of this attitude&#151;a role that most halflings find both amusing and appealing.\n\nFeral garguns hate giants. Bigger and better equipped than the feral garguns, a tribe of giants can usually drive a group of feral garguns from an area, or worse, capture and enslave them. Feral garguns attack and kill giants whenever they have the opportunity.\n\n{b}Feral Gargun Lands{/b}: Feral garguns roam the plains and tundra of the far north, covering huge areas in the search for food, shelter, and tools. Small bands of feral garguns join together once or twice a season to share stories, trade tools and goods, and discuss the dangers of the coming season. Feral gargun lands face constant pressure from groups of giants, orcs, and goblinoids, as well as from powerful individual creatures such as dragons. When such foes appear, the feral garguns meet and decide as a group whether to move on or to fight.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Feral garguns pay homage to their own deities, chief among them Galtha, the Mother of Winter. Galtha teaches her people to survive even in the harshest cold and when food is scarces. &#147;When you can thrive where others cannot even eke out an existence,&#148; says the teachings of Galtha, &#147;then survival and success are assured.&#148;\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Feral gargun adventurers seek to explore the world. They often wish to learn from other races and cultures, seeking to return to their people with treasure, tools, and knowledge that will make life in the northern reaches easier. Some feral garguns leave their tribe hoping to perform some deed great enough for them to earn their father&#146;s name. Because of their size and ferocity, feral gargun barbarians easily find a place in adventuring groups, mercenary squads, or other martial organizations." compset="MonstClass" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rStonechld" name="Stonechild" description="Born of a union of mortal and elemental, a stonechild is a hardy entity grounded in soil and stone and gifted with incredible strength, fortitude, and a keen intellect. Although they are not the outcasts that half-orcs often are, stonechildren are rarely raised among others of their kind. Most stonechildren grow to maturity while living in dwarf or human communities, and those few who stay on the Material Plane often wander alone, taking up the mantle of adventurer.\n\nStonechildren are most comfortable in and under the mountains; because of this preference, they usually end their wandering by settling with a community of dwarves. As they grow older, even the most adventurous stonechildren become more and more likely to seek a way to the Elemental Plane of Earth and surround themselves with others of their kind.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Stonechildren relish challenges and enjoy proving their own strength. They admire those who make their own way in life, and they feel a sense of camaraderie with the earth itself. Even when traveling alone through dangerous areas, stonechildren remain solid and sensible. Stonechildren keep their feelings hidden behind a slow practicality, and when they find someone&#146;s company unpleasant they usually just leave quietly. Stonechildren are stalwart in the face of adversity, whether it takes the form of the physical dangers of combat or the long solitude of life as a wanderer.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: With rough, gray skin and a stony bulk, a stonechild looks like a powerful human made out of stone. Stonechildren have tremendous physical strength and fortitude, and can easily overpower most humanoids. Stonechildren do not have hair, and their eyes are limited to shades of gray, black, or the occasional gem-like hue (usually a muted blue or green). Although their tough hide resembles stone, they are outsiders, not elementals. Stonechildren grow nearly 7 feet tall, and they can easily weigh more than 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Tough, reliable, and focused on the utilitarian, stonechildren get along with most races. Stonechildren are closer to dwarves than any other race, and they often settle in dwarf communities for a time. Many humans and dwarves seek to emulate the strength and silence of the stonechildren, but their strength and practicality can seem alien to elves and gnomes.\n\nOf the few stonechildren who do not live on the Elemental Plane of Earth, most are wanderers, and as such they enjoy the company of halflings. For their part, halflings readily acknowledge the value of having a large, physically powerful stonechild with their troupe.\n\nOn the other hand, stone children sometimes have a difficult time understanding the elf mind-set. Like stonechildren, elves are close to nature, but elves share none of the stonechildren&#146;s connection to stone and the power of the earth, making them seem flighty and unfocused.\n\n{b}Stonechild Lands{/b}: Stonechildren do not have lands of their own on the Material Plane. Even on the Elemental Plane of Earth, their numbers are sparse, but they occasionally form permanent communities along with elementals and other earth creatures. On the Elemental Plane of Earth, stonechildren build secure dwellings in the sides of great caverns, usually with the help of powerful elementals.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Stonechild adventurers usually travel in search of something they desire. For some, this goal is material wealth; for others, it is a chance to study with famed craftsmen. Some want to seek out more of their kind on the Material Plane, while others search for new ways to test themselves in physical combat." compset="MonstClass" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rGnoWhispe" name="Gnome, Whisper" description="Whisper gnomes outwardly resemble common gnomes, but they lack the jovial nature and easy outlook on life that their more common relatives enjoy. Instead, whisper gnomes are creatures of stealth and suspicion. In profession and behavior, they range from dangerous spies to peaceful recluses. Few members of other races can match a whisper gnome&#146;s powers of stealth, and whisper gnome scouts and rangers always stalk any creatures that come within a few miles of their hidden hillside communities.\n\nWhisper gnomes reluctantly ally themselves with common gnomes and other races when necessary. They know that they lack the physical strength and numbers to stand completely on their own.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Whisper gnomes are quiet, suspicious sorts who find it hard to build lasting relationships with members of other races. Although no other race is openly friendly with these reclusive individuals, no race bears them active malice either. Often, whisper gnomes share information about impending threats when allying themselves with more powerful or numerous humanoid races; in most cases, this arrangement has worked out extremely well for both sides.\n\nIf the whisper gnomes&#146; allies find themselves short of a few valuables after the gnomes have left their community, the losses are offset by the whisper gnomes&#146; valuable scouting and information-gathering abilities.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: Whisper gnomes are slightly taller than other gnomes, standing between 3-1/2 and 4 feet tall. Whisper gnomes are skinny, almost gaunt creatures, and rarely weigh more than 40 pounds. Their skin ranges in color from light gray to light green, although none of this variation in skin tone is noticeable without careful attention. Whisper gnomes have gray or blue eyes, but again they are rarely bright or striking in intensity.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Many other humanoid races regard whisper gnomes as they would an untrustworthy cousin&#151;they know that whisper gnomes are unlikely to do any lasting harm or steal their most precious items, but at the same time, they deserve to be watched carefully. Dwarves in particular distrust whisper gnomes; these serious and stoic individuals let whisper gnomes into their cities only under the direst of circumstances.\n\nElves, humans, and half-elves generally tolerate whisper gnomes. Of all the other races, halflings are the most accepting of whisper gnomes, and many whisper gnomes travel for a time with halfling caravans.\n\nHalf-orcs and whisper gnomes get along very well. Whether because the two races are such opposites that they end up respecting the other&#146;s strengths, or because they both often find themselves outcasts from other races, they seem to enjoy each other&#146;s company and approach to life. Half-orcs with nowhere else to go occasionally settle in a whisper gnome community.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: Most whisper gnomes are neutral or neutral good. Whisper gnomes favor personal freedom and choice, but at the same time they value an ordered community and respect the rights of others and&#151;to an extent&#151;the property of others.\n\n{b}Whisper Gnome Lands{/b}: Whisper gnomes live in and among the communities of more common gnomes, or they form small, carefully hidden communities of their own. They favor the rolling hills and light woods that other gnomes enjoy, and like their distant cousins, they live underground.\n\nWhisper gnomes who want a more active lifestyle settle in human lands and find work as spies, emissaries, or as simple thieves.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Whisper gnomes pay homage to Garl Glittergold, but many also venerate Olidamarra. Whisper gnomes are very open-minded about religion, and they find the single-minded religious devotion of other races strange and confining. Most whisper gnomes believe it expedient to pay attention to whatever deity can help them the most in their current situation, and they do not see it as strange to frequently pray to different deities.\n\n{b}Language{/b}: Whisper gnomes speak Gnome, which uses the Dwarven alphabet. Most whisper gnomes also speak Terran, and they sometimes use that tongue as a sort of semi-secret code when in the company of other races.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: Whisper gnomes consider names as semi-permanent aliases at best, and one usually goes by a different name in each non-gnome community he or she visits. When among other gnomes (of any kind), whisper gnomes usually stick to the names given to them by their parents. Whisper gnome family names are similar to, but not exactly like, the clan names of common gnomes.\n\n{i}Male Names{/i}: Alth, Fash, Threan.\n{i}Female Names{/i}: Bella, Freith, Geim, Mala, Nan.\n{i}Family Names{/i}: Bermin, Daergel, Falath, Shrenan.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Whisper gnome adventurers travel to test themselves. They seek not only to try out their powers of speed and stealth against the physical strength of larger creatures, but also to test their own moral limits. Many adventuresome whisper gnomes know that they are capable of stealing from humans and other creatures that can&#146;t hope to compete with their powers of stealth, and they seek some rationale for why they shouldn&#146;t take advantage of this superiority." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rFeralGar2" name="Feral Gargun" description="A small offshoot of the goliath race, feral garguns tear their livelihood out of the frigid northern regions with tooth and claw. Feral garguns derive from goliath and giant parentage. These large, savage humanoids fight in quick, furious bursts of energy. In the barren areas of the north, there is little room for mercy, and the feral garguns have had to learn to be aggressive just to survive.\n\nEven more than their goliath kindred, feral garguns find cities and the trappings of civilization confusing and intimidating. Although individual feral garguns have found ways to adapt to the cities and villages of other races, the majority prefers the simple, nomadic lifestyle of the far north.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Fierce, quick-tempered warriors, feral garguns usually assume that the strongest individual is the leader, and they usually settle disagreements with some nonlethal test of strength. Despite this outward ferocity, feral garguns have a deep sense of personal honor and place a great deal of importance on self-reliance.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: A typical feral gargun is as big as a goliath and larger than the largest half-orc. Most stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. As with their goliath kindred, there is no appreciable difference in height or weight between male and female feral garguns.\n\nFeral garguns are covered in smooth, thick fur. This fur ranges in color from white to light gray to dark brown. Although their bodies are humanoid in shape, the faces of feral garguns are similar to those of bears, and they have longer, narrower faces than other humanoids.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Most feral garguns have little to no interaction with other humanoid races, so when they do interact, they remain curious and polite, at least by their standards. They get along well with goliaths, who trade the feral garguns metal weapons and armor when they have them to spare. Feral garguns also enjoy the company of halflings, valuing their success at maintaining a nomadic lifestyle. Feral garguns some times see halflings as mentor figures because of this attitude&#151;a role that most halflings find both amusing and appealing.\n\nFeral garguns hate giants. Bigger and better equipped than the feral garguns, a tribe of giants can usually drive a group of feral garguns from an area, or worse, capture and enslave them. Feral garguns attack and kill giants whenever they have the opportunity.\n\n{b}Feral Gargun Lands{/b}: Feral garguns roam the plains and tundra of the far north, covering huge areas in the search for food, shelter, and tools. Small bands of feral garguns join together once or twice a season to share stories, trade tools and goods, and discuss the dangers of the coming season. Feral gargun lands face constant pressure from groups of giants, orcs, and goblinoids, as well as from powerful individual creatures such as dragons. When such foes appear, the feral garguns meet and decide as a group whether to move on or to fight.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Feral garguns pay homage to their own deities, chief among them Galtha, the Mother of Winter. Galtha teaches her people to survive even in the harshest cold and when food is scarces. &#147;When you can thrive where others cannot even eke out an existence,&#148; says the teachings of Galtha, &#147;then survival and success are assured.&#148;\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Feral gargun adventurers seek to explore the world. They often wish to learn from other races and cultures, seeking to return to their people with treasure, tools, and knowledge that will make life in the northern reaches easier. Some feral garguns leave their tribe hoping to perform some deed great enough for them to earn their father&#146;s name. Because of their size and ferocity, feral gargun barbarians easily find a place in adventuring groups, mercenary squads, or other martial organizations." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rStonechl2" name="Stonechild" description="Born of a union of mortal and elemental, a stonechild is a hardy entity grounded in soil and stone and gifted with incredible strength, fortitude, and a keen intellect. Although they are not the outcasts that half-orcs often are, stonechildren are rarely raised among others of their kind. Most stonechildren grow to maturity while living in dwarf or human communities, and those few who stay on the Material Plane often wander alone, taking up the mantle of adventurer.\n\nStonechildren are most comfortable in and under the mountains; because of this preference, they usually end their wandering by settling with a community of dwarves. As they grow older, even the most adventurous stonechildren become more and more likely to seek a way to the Elemental Plane of Earth and surround themselves with others of their kind.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Stonechildren relish challenges and enjoy proving their own strength. They admire those who make their own way in life, and they feel a sense of camaraderie with the earth itself. Even when traveling alone through dangerous areas, stonechildren remain solid and sensible. Stonechildren keep their feelings hidden behind a slow practicality, and when they find someone&#146;s company unpleasant they usually just leave quietly. Stonechildren are stalwart in the face of adversity, whether it takes the form of the physical dangers of combat or the long solitude of life as a wanderer.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: With rough, gray skin and a stony bulk, a stonechild looks like a powerful human made out of stone. Stonechildren have tremendous physical strength and fortitude, and can easily overpower most humanoids. Stonechildren do not have hair, and their eyes are limited to shades of gray, black, or the occasional gem-like hue (usually a muted blue or green). Although their tough hide resembles stone, they are outsiders, not elementals. Stonechildren grow nearly 7 feet tall, and they can easily weigh more than 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Tough, reliable, and focused on the utilitarian, stonechildren get along with most races. Stonechildren are closer to dwarves than any other race, and they often settle in dwarf communities for a time. Many humans and dwarves seek to emulate the strength and silence of the stonechildren, but their strength and practicality can seem alien to elves and gnomes.\n\nOf the few stonechildren who do not live on the Elemental Plane of Earth, most are wanderers, and as such they enjoy the company of halflings. For their part, halflings readily acknowledge the value of having a large, physically powerful stonechild with their troupe.\n\nOn the other hand, stone children sometimes have a difficult time understanding the elf mind-set. Like stonechildren, elves are close to nature, but elves share none of the stonechildren&#146;s connection to stone and the power of the earth, making them seem flighty and unfocused.\n\n{b}Stonechild Lands{/b}: Stonechildren do not have lands of their own on the Material Plane. Even on the Elemental Plane of Earth, their numbers are sparse, but they occasionally form permanent communities along with elementals and other earth creatures. On the Elemental Plane of Earth, stonechildren build secure dwellings in the sides of great caverns, usually with the help of powerful elementals.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Stonechild adventurers usually travel in search of something they desire. For some, this goal is material wealth; for others, it is a chance to study with famed craftsmen. Some want to seek out more of their kind on the Material Plane, while others search for new ways to test themselves in physical combat." compset="Race">

  <thing id="cRsmRunMag" name="Rune Magic" description="A runesmith Learns to prepare his arcane spells as runes inscribed on solid objects (usually tablets of stone, but others are possible). He prepares spells as normal, except that instead of readying the spells in his mind, he readies them in the form of runes. Preparing daily spells takes about the same amount of time as normal preparation and requires the same amount of the rest beforehand. A runesmith can leave spell slots unprepared to scribe runes at a later time, just as a wizard can leave spell slots unprepared and fill them later.\nA runesmith who casts a spell prepared in rune form can cast it without any somatic component. however, all spells cast from rune form automatically have a material component (the rune itself). In casting the spell, the rune is erased from the tablet, just as a spell cast normally by a wizardis erased from his mind. A runesmith cannot get around the runic material component by the means of an ability or feat such as eschew materials, although he can use such feats and abilities to waive any other material components for a spell he prepares in rune form, subject to the limitations of the ability.\nIn all other ways, spells prepared in rune form are treated identically to normal spells.\nA runesmith may prepare and use spells in the normal fashion should he so desire." compset="ClSpecial" summary="prepare spells using runes (as still spell)">

  <thing id="wGnoQuiRaz" name="Quickrazor, Gnome" description="The gnome quickrazor is a fast, flashy weapon favored by gnome bards, because it allows them to hold an instrument, attack with a weapon, and still keep one hand free for spellcasting. In addition, many two-weapon-wielding spellcasters find it a perfect off-hand weapon because it allows them to keep their primary weapon in hand and still cast spells with their off hand.\n\nThe quickrazor features a light, wide knife blade with a very small hilt. The weapon is worn tied to the wielder&#146;s wrist in a specially designed sheath. When you attack with a quickrazor, you flick it out in a quick, slashing circle, catching the hilt in your hand at the end of the arc and then snapping it back into its rest.\n\nBecause of this flicking technique, drawing a quickrazor is always a free action, but at the end of your action, you must stow the quickrazor in order to use it properly again on your next turn. Stowing the weapon after attacking with it in this fashion is a free action. Because you must stow the quickrazor at the end of each attack with it, you are treated as unarmed during other creatures&#146; actions.\n\nIf you draw a quickrazor and simply wield it instead of using its intended attack method, it counts as an improvised weapon, imposing a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls even if you have the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat.\n\nQuickrazors are easier to conceal than most weapons, and they grant a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal them. Quickrazors grant a +2 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint in combat.\n\nAttaching a quickrazor and sheath to your wrist so that it can be wielded properly is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A character can have only one quickrazor attached to each wrist at a time." compset="Weapon">

In addition, a second identical spear point is fastened to the butt of the spear, making the weapon doubly dangerous.\n\nThe tougher pointed ends on the blade allow the wielder to set the weapon against a charge.
