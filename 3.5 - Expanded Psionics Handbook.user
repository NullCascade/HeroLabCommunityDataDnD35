Some have gray eyes instead of yellow. All of them dress in drab, unadorned clothing.\n\nAs a rule, githzerai are close-mouthed, keep their own counsel, and trust few outside their own kind.\n\nThey speak their own language (similar enough to the tongue of the githyanki that either could understand the other if they chose to speak instead of fight), but many also speak Common.\n\nMany githzerai are monks; however, sorcerers, rogues, and multiclass githzerai (called zerths) are also indispensable members of a monastery." compset="Race">

Thri-kreen wear little clothing other than a simple harness for carrying weapons and equipment.\n\nThri-kreen speak their own language, and some also know Common." compset="Race">

They enjoy elaborate dress and baroque armor. In fact, they revere weapons and armor, and it is not uncommon for a githyanki to show more regard for panoply of possessions than for its mate.\n\nLike dwarves, githyanki are craftmasters, although they focus exclusively on items of warfare. Their items are distinctive, and non githyanki who acquire them run the risk of immediate retribution should they encounter githyanki.\n\nGithyanki speak their own secret tongue, but most also know Common and Draconic.\n\nMost githyanki encountered outside their homes are fighters.
