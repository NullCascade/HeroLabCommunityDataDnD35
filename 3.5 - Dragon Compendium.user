Regardless of your exact ancestry, you are likely to have one or more unusual physical traits, such as mismatched eyes or untamable and strangely hued hair.\n\nThe descendants of demons tend to have misshapen features and a terrible temper with a decidedly cruel streak. Eladrin descendants tend to have strong emotional reactions (especially positive emotions) and often become fervent (if short-term) supporters of a cause. Characters with slaad ancestry generally have strongly variable mood swings, and they often take on the personality traits, speech patterns, and clothing styles of those around them in a haphazard and unpredictable manner. Those with titan blood often stand head and shoulders above other members of their race; they enjoy experiencing the world around them and become angry when others might merely be bored.\n\nCharacters with the Anarchic Bloodline feat are nearly always chaotic-aligned. They tend to be restless, desiring change above all else. They are prone to act irrationally, based on sudden whims and flights of fancy. The adventurous life, full of excitement, danger, and travel, appeals to them.

Rarely, mortal travelers who spend a significant portion of their lives in a lawfully aligned plane begin to take on some of the traits of that plane that later manifest in their descendants.\n\nMembers of this bloodline are almost exclusively lawful.

Descendants of archons practice the gentler aspects of regimen, living lives in as organized a fashion as possible.\n\nCharacters with the Axiomatic Bloodline feat tend to be organized and consistent; they generally look down on abnormality or spontaneity.

Your heritage probably stems from one of the humanoid-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire, although elemental fire creatures native to the Material Plane can contribute this bloodline as well.\n\nThe descendants of azers see fire as a tool, and they love crafts that control the power of flame.

The descendants of fire mephits have a mischievous nature and enjoy destructive pranks, while characters with steam mephits in their ancestry consider themselves above such behavior and often look down on others with considerable arrogance. Fire giant spawn can be ruthless in achieving their goals, and even others with fire blood see them as brutal. None, however, can be as cruel as the descendants of salamanders.\n\nUsually hot-tempered and unpredictable, characters with the Fire Bloodline feat can also be passionate, egotistical, and unusually prone to destructive behavior. They usually adventure for a chance at personal gain and glory.

They are fond of spells that deceive and manipulate emotions, such as {i}charm person{/i}.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: Your ancestry grants you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, according to the following list.\n\n1st &#151; {i}Detect secret doors{/i}\n2nd &#151; {i}Glitterdust{/i}\n3rd &#151; {i}Tongues{/i}\n4th &#151; {i}Hallucinatory terrain{/i}\n5th &#151; {i}Seeming{/i}\n6th &#151; {i}Mislead{/i}\n7th &#151; {i}Sequester{/i}\n8th &#151; {i}Otto&apos;s irresistible dance{/i}\n9th &#151; {i}Wail of the banshee{/i}\n\n{b}Special{/b}: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class that granted him access to this feat, he gains no additional spells known at those spell levels. This restriction does not apply if he learned any of these spells as a member of another spellcasting class.\n\nAlthough folklore often associates fey creatures with the spirits of the dead, this belief could not be further from the truth&#151;in fact, all fey are inherently bound to life. Thus, characters with the Fey Bloodline feat cannot learn or cast spells that create or control undead, and all such spells are removed from the spell lists of all their spellcasting classes.\n\n{b}Author{/b}: Scott Carter. {b}Source{/b}: #311.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Dragon Compendium" compset="Feat" summary="Gain bonus spells known according to ancestry." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fBloodNecr" name="Necromantic Bloodline" description="One of your ancestors was an undead creature or possessed an unholy link with the undead brought on by frequent contact. While undead do not reproduce by normal means, their infectious taint might affect necromancers and others who deal regularly with the dead or undead. In rare instances a vampire or other undead might feed off a pregnant humanoid and in allowing her to live endow the unborn child with its foul nature.\n\nYour physical characteristics might vary depending on the type of undead creature from which you are descended, but you&apos;re likely to have pale or ashen skin and dark eyes and hair. The touch of undeath in a family almost exclusively comes from intelligent, corporeal undead. It takes powerful magic or extremely bizarre situations for creatures to gain this feat from unintelligent or incorporeal undead. The descendants of ghouls tend to be feral and constantly hungry. Those with ghast ancestors generally have a strong, unpleasant stench, and they often find it difficult to satiate their hunger. Lich-blooded characters value intelligence and generally have elitist personalities, often appearing gaunt and skeletal. Characters descended from mummies tend to have dull but focused personalities, and many have gaunt, dry skin. Descendants of vampires tend to have long canine teeth and commanding, seductive personalities. Wight-blooded characters tend to have clawlike fingernails and toenails, and lean, muscular bodies; they are generally hate-filled loners who hold grudges. Characters with the Necromantic Bloodline feat often favor wearing the blacks, whites, and grays of mourning.\n\nSorcerers with a touch of the undead in their family trees tend to concentrate, appropriately enough, on spells from the school of necromancy. Spells that allow the caster to control a creature&apos;s mind are popular among those descended from vampires.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: Your ancestry gives you a bonus spell known at each spell level, starting at 1st, from the following list.\n\n1st &#151; {i}Cause fear{/i}\n2nd &#151; {i}Ghoul touch{/i}\n3rd &#151; {i}Vampiric touch{/i}\n4th &#151; {i}Contagion{/i}\n5th &#151; {i}Dominate person{/i}\n6th &#151; {i}Eyebite{/i}\n7th &#151; {i}Control undead{/i}\n8th &#151; {i}Trap the soul{/i}\n9th &#151; {i}Wail of the banshee{/i}\n\n{b}Special{/b}: If a character takes this feat any time after 1st level and has already learned any of the spells on this list in the class to which she applies this feat, she gains no additional spells known at those spell levels.

  <thing id="cForceMiMa" name="Force Missile Mage" description="The spell {i}magic missile{/i} is one of the most iconic elements of DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, a favored staple of many arcane Spellcasters and an example of raw magical force. Thus, it is no wonder that a cabal of arcane Spellcasters focuses their studies on this spell, determined to perfect its casting technique above all others. As these Spellcasters obsessively explore {i}magic missile&apos;s{/i} secrets and press its boundaries, every rune and magical symbol of the spell becomes inexorably etched upon their minds. The outcome of such focused study results in the ability to warp the magical energies involved in casting {i}magic missile{/i}, which leads to the creation of new abilities that augment the spell&apos;s effects. Eventually the most devoted researchers come to a new understanding of how magic works, revealing unplumbed depths of power out of the reach of ordinary Spellcasters. These inspired Spellcasters are known as force missile mages.\n\nOther Spellcasters don&apos;t understand the force missile mages&apos; dedication to only one spell and frown upon what they see as misguided research. In their reasoning, force missile mages are a discredit to all Spellcasters as they limit their understanding of magic to delve into the secrets of what many see as ultimately an insignificant spell. Due to this disdain, force missile mages avoid their more widely studied peers, either pursuing their studies subtly or in seclusion. This has led many to take up the life of a wanderer, traveling from one school or library to the next, learning more about their spell of choice and exploring the world.\n\nWizards stand to gain the most from becoming a force missile mage, but some sorcerers and multiclassed clerics also benefit from the class&apos;s unique focus. Clerics with access to the Force domain (see {i}Complete Divine{/i}) often take levels in force missile mage and view their research into one of their faith&apos;s most fundamental spells as a religious undertaking.\n\nWhile many who embark upon the path of the force missile mage claim to do so in order to gain a deeper understanding of magic in general, the majority take on the arduous task in order to become better killers. These arcane snipers hone their skill with {i}magic missiles{/i} not out of curiosity, but for less scholarly reasons: wealth, revenge, or the power to kill with impunity." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="5">
