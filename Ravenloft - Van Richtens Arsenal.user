It holds a single load of shot and follows the rules for reloading firearms. A blunderbuss fires its pellets in a 50-foot cone, and uses an unusual attack process. Make a ranged attack roll. Users without the two required Exotic Weapon Proficiency feats suffer a -8 penalty to this roll, and an additional -4 circumstance penalty if the blunderbuss is not braced. The brace (whether held by an assistant or driven into the ground) must be in an adjacent space, and the relative positions of the blunderbuss and its brace determines the direction of the blunerbuss cone.\n\nThe blunderbuss deals damage to all targets within this cone, ranging from 5d4 to 1d4 points, as determined by the distance between the blunderbuss and the target (the damage decreases by 1d4 per 10 feet). All targets within the cone can make Reflex saves to take half damage. The DC of this saving throw is equal to the result of the attack roll. A blunderbuss cannot score a critical hit.\n\nAdditionally, a target can be shielded by cover from objects (including other targets) between it and the blunderbuss.\n\nIf you fire a blunderbuss without the use of a brace, you must succeed at a Strength check (DC 15) or be knocked off balance until your next turn: foes gain a +2 attack bonus against you, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC, if any.\n\nImprovised ammunition (such as pebbles) acts as tool-quality shot, inflicting a -1 penalty to the attack roll and to each die of damage (to a minimum of 1 pt of damager per d4).

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\n\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.\n\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a {i}magic jar{/i} attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as {i}dominate person{/i}). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the {i}protection from evil{/i} effect. If the {i}protection from evil{/i} effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.\n\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.\n\n{i}Arcane Material Component{/i}: A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3 foot diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded." compset="Spell" summary="+2 to AC and saves, counter mind control, hedge out elementals and outsiders.">

If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.\n\nItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.\n\nOf course, the subject is not magically {i}silenced{/i}, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character&#146;s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as {i}bless{/i} that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.\n\nSee Table 8&#150;5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8&#150;6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.\n\n{i}Invisibility{/i} can be made permanent (on objects only) with a {i}permanency{/i} spell.\n\n{i}Arcane Material Component{/i}: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic." compset="Spell" summary="Subject is invisible for 1 min./level or until it attacks.">

If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.\n\nAny individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you&#146;re {i}blinking{/i} unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.\n\nWhile {i}blinking{/i}, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.\n\nWhile {i}blinking{/i}, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.

You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost.\n\nAn ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial.

  <thing id="sKotS3006" name="Magic Circle against Evil" description="All creatures within the area {b}(10 ft. radius emanation centered on target){/b} gain the effects of a {i}protection from evil{/i} spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome a creature&#146;s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of {i}protection from evil{/i}), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies&#146; spell resistance.\n\nThis spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A {i}magic circle against evil{/i} can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the {i}lesser planar binding{/i}, {i}planar binding{/i}, and {i}greater planar binding{/i} spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the {i}magic circle{/i}. The creature cannot cross the circle&#146;s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell&#146;s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal {i}protection from evil{/i} spell for that creature only.\n\nA {i}magic circle{/i} leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel ({i}astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport{/i}, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature&#146;s extradimensional escape by casting a {i}dimensional anchor{/i} spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the {i}anchor{/i} effect lasts as long as the {i}magic circle{/i} does. The creature cannot reach across the {i}magic circle{/i}, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\n\nYou can add a special diagram (a two dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the {i}magic circle{/i} more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. The DM makes this check secretly. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\n\nA successful diagram allows you to cast a {i}dimensional anchor{/i} spell on the {i}magic circle{/i} during the round before casting any summoning spell. The {i}anchor{/i} holds any called creatures in the {i}magic circle{/i} for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a {i}magic circle{/i} prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the {i}lesser planar binding{/i} spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&#151;even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.\n\nThis spell is not cumulative with {i}protection from evil{/i} and vice versa.\n\n{i}Arcane Material Component{/i}: A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded." compset="Spell" summary="As protection from evil, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.">

The resulting coagulant contains the deceased subject&apos;s spirit, in its entirety.  This coagulant can then be injected into any living, corporeal creature.  The transplanted spirit takes root in its new host as if it had been reincarnated into that form.  Together with the creation of alchemical life, many alchemical philosophers view this dreadful formula as the key to immortality.  In truth, it is straying from the true path, a collapse into unnatural, artificial life.\n\n{b}Prerequisites:{/b} Brew Potion, Memory Coagulant, Purity [Innocence] Coagulant, Int 17+.\n\n{b}Formulation:{/b} DC 33; 1 day; 1,200 gp.\n\n{b}Effects:{/b} This coagulant can be drawn only from a subject that is either dying (below 0 hit points) or has been dead for no longer than a number of rounds equal to the Alchemy check.\n\nOnce the spirit is transferred, if the new host body has its own spirit (as all natural living creatures do), the transplanted soul manifests as an altemate personality.  Use the &#147;Multiple Personalities&quot; Madness effect in the {i}Ravenloft Setting{/i} book to determine when the soul can gain control of its host. If the host body has no mind or spirit of its own (as with an alchemical creation), the transplanted spirit gains full control of its new body.  Unlike {i}raise dead{/i} or similar magic, the deceased spirit is trapped by the coagulant and need not be willing to retum to a living body.\n\nThe soul can also be transferred to a fresh corpse, provided the body is completely intact and has been dead for no more than the Alchemy check in rounds.  lf the corpse meets these requirements, the infusion of a new life force restores the body to life.  Otherwise, the infused corpse animates as a type of corporeal undead with HD equal to half of the transferred spirit&#145;s level.\n\nSome life essence is always dispersed during the transferal. The transplanted spirit automatically loses 1 level, or 1 point of Constitution if the subject had only 1 Hit Die. If the spirit is not transplanted into a new host by the time the coagulant becomes inert, it is freed to move on to its final destination in the afterlife. While the spirit is trapped within the coagilant, however, spells such as {i}raise dead{/i} or {i}resurrection{/i} have no effect.\n\nCrafting or using essential coagulant requires a powers check.\n\n{i}Partial Failure:{/i} The transplanted soul is improperly anchored in its new host.

  <thing id="fRvnHolPur" name="Holistic Purifier" description="{b}Prerequisites:{/b} Brew Potion, Corporeal Purifier, Philosophical Purifier, lnt 17+.\n\n{b}Formulation:{/b} DC 33; 1 day; 1,200 gp.\n\nAs with the philosophical purifier, the alchemist must select specific ethical and moral traits to infuse into the application at the time of creation.  Any living creature that ingests or is injected with this purifier undergoes a startling physical and mental transformation, its mind and body shifting to perfectly reflect the infused traits.\n\nWhen the transformation ends, all subconscious elements of the imbued alignment are purged from the subject&apos;s psyche, and the subject remains remarkably true to his core philosophies for quite some time.  While a few alchemists in the past have relied on this formula as a tool to resist base temptations, even they knew that they had sacrificed true enlightenment for an ultimately destructive substitute.\n\n{i}Editor&apos;s Note: This knowledge recently aided Laurie and I in the resolution of a series of murders taking place in Morfenzi.  The murders greatly benefited a highly respected merchent, but several of the crims had been witnessed by folk who discribed a degenerate thug, perhaps even a caliban, who bore little resemblance to the suspect.  Indeed, the killer had done little to conceal his identity.  Armed with our new knowlwedge, however we searched the merchant&apos;s home and discovered a small cache of purifiers that he had somehow accuired.  We suspect that he had been transforming himself into his own hired killer, presumably so as to keep both his hands and soul free of stain as he eliminated his rivals.  Unfortunately, the Falkovian authorities executed the man immediately once we brought our findings to light, preventing us from truely confirming his guilt.{/i} &#151;GWF\n\n{b}Effects:{/b} The physical transformation is as effective as the {i}alter self{/i} spell; like that spell, the physical changes induced by this formula grant a + 10 bonus to the subject&#146;s Disguise checks.  Creatures that become chaotic may develop asymmetrical features, while creatures that become evil may appear markedly degenerate. Creatures that become good may grow more beatific, while those that become lawful may look perfectly symmetrical. For each step the subject&#146;s moral alignment shifts toward good, its OR lowers by an effective -1, while the reverse is true for subjects that become evil. (Thus, the OR of a good creature that becomes evil rises by +2 for the transformation&#146;s duration.)\n\nWhile transformed, the subject&#146;s behavior is always perfectly true to the infused alignment. The transformation&apos;s duration is equal to twice the Alchemy check in minutes.\n\nFor a number of days following the transfonnation equal to the Alchemy check, the purifier&apos;s aftereffects grant the subject a competence bonus to Will saves to resist any mind-influencing effects that would cause her to act against her alignment. The bonus is +1 for each step the subject&#145;s alignment changed while transformed, to a maximum of +4 (as with a lawful good creature that had become chaotic evil).\n\n{b}Partial Failure:{/b} The purifier functions normally but is addictive.  When the purifier&apos;s after effects wear off, the subject passes through a detoxifying period, suffering an effective reduction of &#151;2 points from each ability score for a number of days equal to the Alchemy score.  lf the subject acquires another dose of the purifier, she must succeed at a Will save (DC 17 + Intelligence modifier of the alchemist who created the addictive purifier) to resist using the new dose.  Taking another dose of the same alignment purifier immediately removes all detoxification penalties." compset="Feat" summary="Alchemical Feat - like the alter self spell (see description)" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="sClrEterSl" name="Eternal Slumber" description="Eternal slumber rids the world of the undead, destroying them without harming their bodies so that their souls can still enjoy their afterlife. If this spell is cast on a corpse, the subject becomes immune to animate dead. The recipient also gains spell resistance equal to (10 + caster level) to any other spells that would interfere with its etemal reward, such as create undead and create greater undead. This acts as a permanent ward for that corpse.\nIf eternal slumber is cast upon a victim slain by an undead with the create spawn ability, the spell can also prevent the subject from rising from its grave. If the corpse was an unwilling victim and the undead it would become has fewer Hit Dice than the caster has levels, the subject will not rise from the grave. If the subject was a willing participant or the undead it is due to become has more Hit Dice than the caster&#146;s levels, the subject must make a levelcheck (1d2O + subject&apos;s Hit Dice) against the spell resistance described above. If the subject succeeds at its level check, the corpse still animates as undead.\nIf eterenal slumber is cast upon an existing undead cteamre, that subject must make a Will save. If the save succeeds, the subject becomes immune to the caster&#146;s eternal slumber spells for one week and suffers no ill effects. If it fails, the subject feels an overwhelming desire to return to its grave. This desire persists for one hour per caster level; if the undead can reach its grave in this time, it immediately falls into astupor. If the desire wears off before the undead can retum to its grave, it suffers no adverse effects. This stupor generally prompts ghosts to move on to their etemal reward. Vampires and ancients only sleep until their bodies are physically disturbed.\nLiches, however, are affected somewhat differently. If they fail the Will save, they are banished to their phylacteries for 24 hours. However, they remain fully aware during this time and return to their own bodies or the nearest corpse when the time is up.\nThis spell has no effect on living creatures.\nDarklords gain a +4 bonus to their saves and automatically wake at the next dusk. Those foolish enough to use this spell against darklords should probably use the time they gain to ?ee the domain; the lord is unlikely to forgive or forget this offense within the caster&apos;s lifetime.\n\n{b}EXP Cost: {/b}500 XP" compset="Spell">

  <thing id="sClrMystCa" name="Mystic Cage" description="This spell is perhaps the most powerful tool in a demon hunter&#146;s arsenal. With it, the caster can summon a fiend and trap it within its phylactery (see page 132 of {i}Van Ritchen&apos;s Arsenal{/i}). A fetish, an object representative of the fiend (ideally its phylactery), must be placed on the pedestal in the center of the cage just before the spell is cast. This involves chanting the fiend&#146;s true name; if an alias or the wrong name is used instead, the spell fails and has no effect. However, if all goes well, the fetish is summoned into the container that hangs above the pedestal, and the fiend takes its place in an explosion of mist.\nAs long as at least four living creatures that were present at the start of the spell remain within the cage, the fiend is rendered unable to leave the cage&apos;s boundaries, whether by magic, planar travel or physical movement. The caster can stand as one of these guardians and still maintain the spell.Unfortunately, being able to trap the fiend is not without cost; the guardian creatures lose 1 hit point each minute. No saving throw is possible to avoid this damage, but a spellcaster&apos;s concentration is unaffected by the draining.\nThe fiend can escape if it physically destroys the cage or if fewer than four of the original life forces remain. Most fiends realize instinctively that the easiest way to escape is to kill its guardians or otherwise convince them to leave the cage. The mystick cage grants no protection against any of the fiend&apos;s magical abilities or physical attacks.\nThe spell ends when the fiend returns to its phylactery. This occurs when the fiend is reduced to O hit points or after 30 minutes (whichever occurs first). Once the fiend is returned to its phylactery, it is trapped there for Z4 hours. If the phylactery is destroyed during this time, the fiend is permanently annihilated. As an outsider, the fiend cannot be restored to life. Note that if some object other than the phylactery is used in the mystick cage, the fiend still retreats to its phylactery, wherever it may be. lf the caster does not have it in his possession, he must find it within one day to be sure of destroying the fiend. If the fiend does not have a phylactery, it is permanently destroyed at the climax of this spell.\nIf the phylactery is used as the fetish for the cage, the spell bypasses the fiend&#146;s spell resistance, automatically summoning and trapping the creature. lf some other object is used, spell resistance still applies.\nThis spell can affect only creatures with a reality wrinkle. This includes all outsiders with the Good or Evil descriptors, including native outsiders such as lawful good or lawful evil monks with the Perfect Self ability. Mortal creatures that temporarily become an outsider through spells do not gain a reality wrinkle and thus cannot be summoned to the cage.\n\n{b}Focus:{/b} A fetish (some object representative of the fiend to be summoned) and the cage itself. The circular cage is composed of wood and wrought iron and has a diameter of 30 feet. Constructing the cage costs 5,000 gp, plus another 1,000 gp for every 5 feet of diameter over 30 ftt This includes the cost of holy water and consecrated tapers that must be integrated into the cage to contain the fiend." compset="Spell">

  <thing id="sSorMystCa" name="Mystic Cage" description="This spell is perhaps the most powerful tool in a demon hunter&#146;s arsenal. With it, the caster can summon a fiend and trap it within its phylactery (see page 132 of {i}Van Ritchen&apos;s Arsenal{/i}). A fetish, an object representative of the fiend (ideally its phylactery), must be placed on the pedestal in the center of the cage just before the spell is cast. This involves chanting the fiend&#146;s true name; if an alias or the wrong name is used instead, the spell fails and has no effect. However, if all goes well, the fetish is summoned into the container that hangs above the pedestal, and the fiend takes its place in an explosion of mist.\nAs long as at least four living creatures that were present at the start of the spell remain within the cage, the fiend is rendered unable to leave the cage&apos;s boundaries, whether by magic, planar travel or physical movement. The caster can stand as one of these guardians and still maintain the spell.Unfortunately, being able to trap the fiend is not without cost; the guardian creatures lose 1 hit point each minute. No saving throw is possible to avoid this damage, but a spellcaster&apos;s concentration is unaffected by the draining.\nThe fiend can escape if it physically destroys the cage or if fewer than four of the original life forces remain. Most fiends realize instinctively that the easiest way to escape is to kill its guardians or otherwise convince them to leave the cage. The mystick cage grants no protection against any of the fiend&apos;s magical abilities or physical attacks.\nThe spell ends when the fiend returns to its phylactery. This occurs when the fiend is reduced to O hit points or after 30 minutes (whichever occurs first). Once the fiend is returned to its phylactery, it is trapped there for Z4 hours. If the phylactery is destroyed during this time, the fiend is permanently annihilated. As an outsider, the fiend cannot be restored to life. Note that if some object other than the phylactery is used in the mystick cage, the fiend still retreats to its phylactery, wherever it may be. lf the caster does not have it in his possession, he must find it within one day to be sure of destroying the fiend. If the fiend does not have a phylactery, it is permanently destroyed at the climax of this spell.\nIf the phylactery is used as the fetish for the cage, the spell bypasses the fiend&#146;s spell resistance, automatically summoning and trapping the creature. lf some other object is used, spell resistance still applies.\nThis spell can affect only creatures with a reality wrinkle. This includes all outsiders with the Good or Evil descriptors, including native outsiders such as lawful good or lawful evil monks with the Perfect Self ability. Mortal creatures that temporarily become an outsider through spells do not gain a reality wrinkle and thus cannot be summoned to the cage.\n\n{b}Focus:{/b} A fetish (some object representative of the fiend to be summoned) and the cage itself. The circular cage is composed of wood and wrought iron and has a diameter of 30 feet. Constructing the cage costs 5,000 gp, plus another 1,000 gp for every 5 feet of diameter over 30 ftt This includes the cost of holy water and consecrated tapers that must be integrated into the cage to contain the fiend." compset="Spell">

Outsiders that do not have reality wrinkles (such as those with the Mists descriptor, or those with 22+ corruption points) are unaffected by this spell.\nlf the target of upsurge is an elemental, it suffers 1d6 hit points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 20d6). An elemental that makes a successful Fortitude save takes half damage.  \nAlthough they are bound to their domains, the darklords (even those who are outsiders or fey) are unaffectected by this spell.

  <thing id="sPalFeasOb" name="Feast of Oblivion" description="This spell infuses the caster with the power of light and goodness, making his flesh seem repulsive to any evil creatures that might feast upon it.\nUnless they are truly desperate, most evil animals, beasts. magical beasts and vermin will avoid attacking the caster, particularly by biting. They find the faint smell of purity that comes from the spellcastet&apos;s skin to be repulsive, although neutral and good creatures are unable to detect it (and are unaffected by this spell). Even more powerful and intelligent evil creatures, like ghouls and hags, will think twice about attacking, unless they have something to gain by the castet&#146;s death other than a meal. lf an evil creature has survived the effects of a feast of oblivion before, or has witnessed others of its ilk being affected by it, it may remember and is unlikely to fall victim to the spell again &#151; knowing well enough to leave such bodies alone.\nThe true strength of this spell lies in its contingency-like effect on evil creatures that consume the caster&apos;s ?esh. Approximately 1 minute after they have begun their meal, a crippling pain strikes at the core of any evil creature that has eaten so much as an ounce of ?esh so protected. The divine power that was stored in the caster&#146;s ?esh is released into their bodies, burning them for ld8 hit points of divine damage for each caster level (to a maximum of 5d8). Such creatures get no saving throw and the damage bypasses their spell resistance.\nAlthough they generally do not consume the flesh of their victims, vampires are also affected by this spell, though to a lesser extent. Upon drinking the caster&#146;s blood, the vampire must make a Fortitude save, with a +1 unholy bonus per century of age. If it succeeds, the vampire is slowed (as the spell) for 1 minute per caster level. If the vampire fails, it immediately falls unconscious for a full 24 hours. This swoon is exactly like the sleep that they enter into during the day, so if the vampire has the Light Sleep salient ability, it can still respond if threatened in any way. Most vampires, however, simply collapse where they stand, exposing them to the dangers of sunlight and discovery by humans.\n\n{b}Material Component:{/b} A vial of holy water, a clove of garlic, and a pinch of powdered cold iron." compset="Spell">

Dangerous curses can only he carried for 10 minutes per caster level. Lethal curses (such as undeath) and the curses that bind a darklord to his domain cannot be transferred -the hold on their victims is simply too powerful to loosen.\nThe caster automatically loses his Innocence if he transfers a curse to himself. if the curse is particularly venomous, such as afflicted lycanthropy, the caster may lose his paladin abilities while the curse is in effect. However, once the curse retums to its rightful owner, no permanent ill effects remain with the caster." compset="Spell">

Each clove of bloodseeker garlic is good for a single use.  Depending on the individual vampire, vampire blood can have a number of different effects. While the blood of some blood suckers is little different from  human blood, other vampires may have blood that is caustic, explosive, or hypnotic (other effects are entirely possible though). Caustic vampire blood does 1d6 damage on a direct hit and 1 point of splash damage. Explosive vampire blood does 1d3 damage to everything within a 3 foot blast radius when exposed to sunlight. Hypnotic blood causes those touched by it to be affected by the vampire&#145;s domination ability, as though the vampire had made a gaze attack. Vampire blood produces these effects so long as the vampire the blood was drawn from lives. Should a vampire be slain, there is a 50% chance that it&#146;s blood will become inert and turn putrid ( hypnotic vampire blood always turns putrid).

Therefore the divination response might be: &quot;Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.&quot; In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive. If your party doesn&apos;t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. (For example, the troll could move away and take the treasure with it.)\n\nThe base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.\n\nAs with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time." compset="Special" summary="Casts Divination as a spell-like ability.">

The subject must meditate on the glory of the Mominglord for the week before the full moon. He must hold the hands during his meditations without fail during this time and may not rise from his meditations. Failing either of these requirements spoils the cure.  Fortunately, the hands make the subject immune to hunger, thirst, fatigue and the need for sleep or elimination during the meditations.\n\n{i}Editor&apos;s Note: We have heard hints that there exists a companion relic to the hands of the Dawn Healer.  According to rumor, a similar pair of mummified hands have surfaced in Barovia as well, in the former lands of Gundarak.

  <thing id="iRLBloodkn" name="Bloodknife [Artifact]" description="NEEDS SPECIAL and Bootstrap script for Diamond of the Sun.\nNEEDS Special for Good/Evil Wielder Script and Wolf Companion.\n\n&#147;The one who was orphaned shall return during the night of greatest darkness with the bane of  the evil one. With the wolf spirit, the one shall claim the birthright of the sun, and the evil one&apos;s shadow will be cleansed from the land. Blood shall turn to water, and shadow tum to light; all will be restored. and day will burn the night.&quot; {i}&#151;Ancient Tales of the Vistani{/i}, author unknown.  The prophecy recorded above is part of the lore relating to an artifact called the {i}Bloodknife{/i}, also known to vampires as the {i}Bane of the Ancients{/i}.\n\nTreasure hunters throughout the Land of Mists have searched for this dagger for nearly two centuries.  The {i}Bloodknife{/i} is a large dagger with a foot-long blade, and the whole of the weapon, hilt and blade, is crafted from a single huge ruby. Embedded in the hilt are two small cameos, one depicting a wolf with open jaws howling at the moon, and the other depicting an aristocratic, mustached man whose mouth is filled with fangs. The wolf cameo has an indentation where a small jewel referred to as the {i}&#147;Diamond of the Sun&quot;{/i} is supposed to be fitted. The {i}Diamond ofthe Sun{/i} was supposedly a small diamond with gold veins that magnified the powers of the {i}Bloodknife{/i}, but its current fate remains a mystery.\n\nBeyond the basic facts of the item itself, the history and purpose of the {i}Bloodknife{/i} are unclear.  Wild tales of ancient royal bloodlines, Vistani kingdoms, reincamation, lycanthropy, vampire warlords, and sundry other fairy-tale embellishments make an accurate reading of the {i}Bloodknife{/i}&apos;s true past extremely difficult.  Thus, research into the {i}Bloodknife{/i} has been relegated to a position of low priority for our scholars.\n\nThe {i}Bloodknife{/i} is a +2 dagger that glows with ruddy light.  The dagger&apos;s glow intensifies in the presence of vampires, becoming equal to that of a torch.  In addition, the {i}Bloodknife{/i} tingles and emits a throbbing hum when within 500 feet of a vampire.  By watching the intensity of these effects, the {i}Bloodknife&apos;s{/i} owner can detect the location and proximity of these bloodsuckers In the hands of a character of good alignment, the {i}Bloodknife{/i} drains the negative energy of any vampire or vampire spawn on a successful hit, instantly destroying the creature.  The target can make a Will save (DC 25) to negate this effect.  True vampires gain a +1 profane bonus to this saving throw for each century of undeath.  Thus, a 500-year-old vampire makes the Will save with a +5 bonus. Vampire spawn do not gain this benefit.  If a vampire successfully saves against the energy-draining effects of the {i}Bloodknife{/i}, it is immune to the {i}Bloodknife{/i}&apos;s energy drain from that point on.  When a character of good alignment takes possession of the {i}Bloodknife{/i}, the dagger {i}awakens{/i} the nearest wolf (as per the spell) and grants it a telepathic rapport with the knife&apos;s owner.  The wolf then seeks out the owner and joins her as an animal companion.  The wolf companion granted by the knife is {b}{u}not{/u}{/b} a dread companion, and has the alignment of the knife&#146;s new owner.\n\nIn the hands of an evil-aligned wielder, the {i}Bloodknife{/i} drains the souls of the living on a successful hit.  Living victims can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 25) to negate this effect.  The wielder of the {i}Bloodknife{/i} may choose to absorb part of the souls claimed by the weapon, adding an effective +1 extra hit point to her total for every 2 Hit Dice possessed by the creature slain.  Thus, if an evil wielder slays a living creature with 7 HD, she can add +3 hit points to her total.\n\nThe owner keeps this effective bonus to her hit points for as long as she retains physical possession of the {i}Bloodknife.{/i}  Using the {i}Bloodknife{/i} in this manner requires a powers check.\n\nIf the {i}Diamond of the Sun{/i} is found and placed in its setting, then three times pet day the wielder of the {i}Bloodknife{/i} can produce a {i}sunburst{/i} as the spell cast by a 20th-level caster.  The {i}sunburst{/i} is always centered on the {i}Bloodknife{/i}.\n\nThe {i}Bloodknife{/i} was specifically created to find the true heirs to the throne of an obscure domain, conquered long ago by a cruel and despotic vampire lord known as Velkaarn, and to aid them in his destruction.  The {i}Bloodknife{/i} acts as a death bane weapon against this foul being.\n\nUnfortunately, the princes of that land are long dead, the blade&#146;s task unfinished.  Because of this failure, their souls are trapped in the Realm of Dread, rebom time and again, until the day Velkaarn is slain.  The {i}Bloodknife{/i} gravitates toward the reincarnated souls of its true masters, slowly working its way closer to its target over time.  The {i}Bloodknife{/i} gravitates toward human or half-Vistani player characters with the {i}Reincanated{/i} feat, as well those with the {i}Lunatic{/i} feat." compset="MagicWep" uniqueness="useronce">

When the statuette is tossed to the  ground and the command word spoken, the {i}Cat of Felkovic{/i} transforms, like a figurine of wondrous power, into a massive great cat with incisors the length of a man&apos;s forearm. This cat obeys whoever speaks the command word to bring it forth.  The cat is harmless so long as it is fed once each day.  If the cat is recalled while it is eating, its kill becomes part of the statue, appearing in miniature beneath the cat&#146;s jade forepaws.\n\nAccording to reports, the {i}Cat of Felkovic{/i} is intimately linked to Baron Urik von Kharkov of Valachan.  Apparently, the {i}Cat of Felkovic{/i} attacked Baron von Kharkov shortly after he inherited the baronial title from his late father.\n\n{i}Editors Note: By some accounts, Felkovic was a mage who had been in love with one of the baron&apos;s many doomed brides, and he somehow crafted the cat to seek revenge. He does not seem to have survived to put his creation to use, however.{/i}&#151;GWF\n\nEach day the cat is not fed by its owner, it animates on its own during the night and hunts for meat.  The first night, the {i}Cat of Felkovic{/i} merely animates in the form of a common house cat.  Each subsequent night, the cat awakens as a progressively larger, fiercer cat.\n\nThe cat hunts and kills the most convenient prey appropriate to its current size, starting with birds and mice as a house cat and working up to human prey, such as its owner, as a dire tiger.  When animated by hunger, the {i}Cat of Felkovic{/i} cannot be controlled by its owner.  When the cat has eaten its fill, it returns to where it animated and reverts to figurine form.\n\nIn addition to the statistics and abilities of each form it takes, the {i}Cat of Felkovic{/i} is immune to all spell and spell-like effects and has damage reduction 30/+2.  lf the cat is &quot;slain,&quot; it reverts to figurine form until the next night it needs to feed.\nThe {i}Cat of Felkovic{/i} is one of the few objects that can permanently slay Baron Urik von Kharkov.

  <thing id="iRLRavanaB" name="Ravana&apos;s Bane [Artifact]" description="While many details of this account strain credibility, you may find this excerpt from an interview with Sri Rajian sorcerer and explorer Soma Purusha to be of interest:\n\nDr. Noge Spengler: Can you tell me about the item in this drawing? (Indicates a stylized ink drawing of an omate arrow or bolt)\n\nSoma Punishaz Yes, of course. This is a sketch of {i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i}, a legendary weapon in the lore of my land. lt is supposedly a crossbow bolt of great mystic power.\n\nSpengler: Can you elaborate on the back- ground of this piece for me?\n\nPurusha: According to the tale, the Maharaja Arijani, in days long past, fought a terrible war to rid to world of the demons known in our land as {i}rakshasa{/i}. So great and terrible was the wrath he poured upon the tiger-demons that the god of the {i}rakshasa{/i}, Ravana, come to earth in living form to plead for Arijani to have mercy on his people.\n\nSpengler: And what did Maharaja Arijani do?\n\nPurusha: Arijani stole the secret of the tiger-demons so that they could lay neither claw nor fang upon him.  He then used the sacred bolt {i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i} and shot Ravana in the heart, slaying the {i}rakshasa{/i} god instantly.\n\nSpengler: Most interesting. What of {i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i} today!\n\nPurusha: The bolt absorbed the taint of the god of the tiger demons, becoming the only artifact of the {i}rakshasa{/i} that could touch Maharaja Arijani. For a long time {i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i} was lost.  Recently, it was found cast into the form ofa statue, but it was restored to its true form by an artisan in Tvashti. I know not where it passed from there, but the power of {i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i} undoubtedly still lurks in this world, hungry for the soul of Arijani.\n\nThis silver crossbow bolt was used by the darklord ofSri Raji, the {i}rakshasa{/i} Arijani, to slay the avatar of his father, Ravana, god of the rakshasa. {i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i} acts as a +1 silver crossbow bolt. However, should it be used against Arijani, {i}Ranvana&apos;s Bane{/i} instantly slays the darklord with a successful attack. After slaying Arijani, {i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i} will melt into a pile of twisted slag; this is the only known means of destroying this artifact.\nPossessing {i}Ravana&#146;s Bane{/i} is hazardous, for this weapon opens its owner to the will of Ravana.  Anyone who owns {i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i} for one month draws the attention of Ravana&apos;s minions, who will attempt to enter the Realm of Dread via transposition with the owner. Once the transposition is complete, the owner of {i}Ravana&#146;s Bane{/i} will have been replaced by a {i}rakshasa{/i}, who attempts to seek out and slay Arijani.\n{i}Ravana&apos;s Bane{/i} is currently hidden deep in the jungles of Sri Raji. The bolt lies on an altar in a crumbling temple of the destroyer god, Shiva, where monks guard the artifact from the unenlightened." compset="MagicWep" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="tmRLEnliCh" name="Enlightened Child" description="{align left}\n{indent 25}\nThese uncannily lifelike constructs begin their existence in the roiling vats overseen by alchemical philosophers. Some such creators give life to these alchemical &quot;children&quot; to restore the dead or insidiously replace the living; a few even spawn alchemical bodies to recreate themselves in a seemingly more perfect form.\nThe formulation costs to create an alchemical child listed under the Philosophical Child and Enlightened Child formulae assume that the child to be created to Medium-size or smaller.  Creating an alchemical child requires a vat large and sturdy enough to hold its coalescing body, so larger creatures require suitably large apparatus.  This child&#146;s intended size determined the extra cost required in its creation, as shown below. Half of this extra cost represents additions to the alchemist&apos;s lab, which can be reused.\n{indent -25}\n{b}\nCreature&apos;s   Formulation\n    Size        Cost Modifier\n{/b}\nLarge             x4\nHuge             x8\nGargantuan    x16\nColossal        x32\n\n{b}Creating an Alchemical Child{/b}\n{indent 25}&quot;Alchemical child&quot; is a template that can be added to any corporeal aberration, animal, beast, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid or vermin (referred to hereafter as the &#147;base creature&#148;) . The creature&#146;s type becomes &#147;construct.&#148; It uses all of the base creature&#146;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.\nAlchemical children exist in two subtypes, as determined by the formula used to concoct them: philosophical children and enlightened children.  Unless noted otherwise, all qualities listed here apply to both subtypes.\n{b}Hit Dice:{/b} lncrease to d10. Unlike the results of a {i}clone{/i} spell, an alchemical child does not gain the memories of the original creature, unless granted those memories through the use of an essential coagulant or similar means. Thus, an alchemical child does not gain any of its base creature&apos;s class levels.  If a child is based on a creature that uses class levels to determine its Hit Dice (like human characters), the child is considered a 1st-level warrior until it receives a set of memories or gains levels on its own.\n{indent -25}\n{b}Speed:{/b} Same as the base creature.\n{b}AC:{/b} The base creature&apos;s natural armor increased by +2.\n{b}Attacks:{/b} Same as the base creature.\n{b}Damage:{/b} Same as the base creature.\n{indent 25}{b}Special Attacks:{/b} The alchemical child retains all of special attacks of the base creature (except class abilities, as noted above).  At the time of creation, an alchemist concocting an enlightened child (only) may also select three &quot;refinements&quot; from the following list to bestow on her creation.  The alchemist must add a special ingredient to the concoction to bestow each refinement.\n{b}Special Qualities:{/b} An alchemical child retains all the special qualities of the base creature (except class abilities, as noted above) and those listed below, and also gains the construct type and the lifelike subtype. When an alchemical child dies, it immediately dissolves into a pool of steaming ichor.\n{i}Lifelike (Ex):{/i} The creation of an alchemical child is such a sophisticated process that the resulting creature mimics a living biology in many ways.  The child can eat, drink, breathe and sleep, though it does not truly need to do any of this. The child even ages nonnally for a member of the base creature&#146;s race and bleeds if cut, though the fluid is more akin to quintessence than true blood. Lifelike constructs are not immune to bleeding effects or subdual damage, and they die at -10 hit points (rather than at 0 hp), like a living creature. An alchemical child is considered a living creature in respect to the effects of alchemical formulae.\n{i}Resistance (Ex):{/i} An alchemical child has acid resistance 20.\n{i}Mental Bond (Ex):{/i} An alchemical child is telepathically linked to its creator. It can convey to her everything it sees and hears and she can send it telepathic commands, up to a range of 500 yards.\n{indent -25}\n{b}Saves:{/b} Same as the base creature.\n{b}Abilities:{/b} No CON. +2 STR +2 DEX\n{b}Skills:{/b} Same as the base creature, except that alchemical children do not receive any of the base creature&apos;s lntelligence&#151;modified skills (unless the child is given a memory as detailed above).\n{b}Feats:{/b} Same as the base creature.\n{b}Challenge Rating:{/b} Same as the base creature +1.\n{b}Treasure:{/b} Standard.\n{b}Alignment:{/b} Any (same as creator).\n{b}Advancement:{/b} Same as the base creature." compset="Template" uniqueness="unique">
