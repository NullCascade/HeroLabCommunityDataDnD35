    <info_todo><![CDATA[Correct Feats:
  Add proper coding to feats.

Add Prestige Classes:
--> Breachgnome
--> Great Rift Skyguard
--> Orc Warlord
--> Warsling Sniper



Well mostly my work is done.

I still have some feats that will not work properly.

Races of Faerun
Calishite Elementalist, Chondathan Missionary, Eldritch Linguist, Gold Dwarf Dweomersmith, Hin Wandermage, Dwarf Shield Warder.

All of these Feats add specific spells to a person's spell list, most require you to either be a sorc/wiz or a cleric.

Imp. Energy Reist      Reqs racial/template resistance.
Jutunbrud                Alters the height and weight of the hero
Shadow Song Mag    Reqs Bardic Music class ability.
Talfirian Song           Reqs Bardic Music class ability.]]></info_todo>

Mostly used as a building material in fantastic castles, glassteel can also be fashioned into weapons and armor. Glassteel is stronger and lighter than iron&#151;but it&#146;s fantastically expensive.\n\nJust as does adamantine, glassteel grants a nonmagical enhancement bonus to weapons and armor made with it. And like mithral, glassteel armor counts as one category lighter (although light armor is still light), spell failure chance is decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are decreased by 3. Nonweapon and nonarmor items made of glassteel weigh half what they otherwise would.\n\nGlassteel weapons and armor are hard to spot at a distance (&#150;4 penalty on Spot checks), but just because armor is transparent doesn&#146;t mean that the person underneath the armor is likewise concealed. In combat, glassteel&#146;s transparency is mostly a decorative curiosity rather than a tactical advantage.\n\nGlassteel has a hardness of 20 and 40 hit points per inch ofthickness.

  <thing id="rAraviel" name="Elf, Winged (Avariel)" description="The avariels, or winged elves, are without a doubt the most reclusive and least numerous of the elven subraces on Faer&#251;n. Many scholars have long dismissed them as creatures of myth. In truth, small numbers of avariels still dwell in Faer&#251;n, concealed in hidden enclaves and remote regions.\n\nThe most striking feature of the avariels is their soft, feathered wings. These wings have spans of anywhere from twelve to sixteen feet and are usually white, but may also be gray, brown, black, or speckled. Avariels take great pride in their wings and spend long hours grooming them. Their skin is pale, often porcelain white, with tinges of blue or faint silver. They have silverwhite or black hair, with other shades being rare but not unheard of. The avariels&#146; eyes are rather large and more expressive than those of other elves, and they tend to be brilliant shades of blue or green. A few avariel have scintillating violet eyes as pure as amethysts. Avariels stand 5&apos;9&quot; tall on average, with thin, graceful limbs and angular facial features. They are the most beautiful and striking of the elven races, although too often this beauty is marred by haughtiness and condescension toward their landbound kin, whom they often pity.\n\nAvariels are even more delicate than other elves, and their movements are quick, calculated, and graceful. They prefer to wear loose fitting, diaphanous clothing that catches the wind in flight and ripples and weaves in the air. Armor is almost never worn, because it tends to weigh the avariels down and hinder their graceful motion. Avariels cannot fly while wearing heavy armor.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Races of Faerun" compset="Race">

  <thing id="rHalfDrow" name="Half-Drow" description="A half-drow is the offspring of a human and a drow, or a drow and a half-elf. Half-drow can interbreed with any other half-elven sub-race, except aquatic elves. Inside drow occupied lands half-drow are a common sight. Outside they are a rare sight indeed.\n\nBorn able to walk, almost from birth Half-Drow progress through early development stages quite rapidly. Motor skills and language skills follow, and by their second year they could easily be mistaken &#151; drow-like features not withstanding &#151; for a human eight-year old. However, true sexual maturity, strangely given their rapid start, will not occur in half-drow until they reach their mid-twenties.\n\nOnce adolescence sets in, females ovulate only twice yearly. Males, much like males of other species, are virile more or less continuously from the start of adolescence until death. As they approach middle years &#151; middle-seventies &#151; many begin to experience hair-loss, but (like all of elven stock) do not wrinkle, as humans do. Instead, they experience bone-loss as their other elven races do. This often leaves them frail in their elder years, and prone to debilitating bone breaks. Though violent deaths often come much sooner for half-drow, death in the form of advanced age usually comes between 150 and 180 years.\n\nHalf-Drow are stockier than their elven parents, and noticably more muscular often with a &quot;{i}chiseled{/i}&quot; appearance to their features. Unlike full-blooded Drow, the entire sclera of the eye is not colored; like humans only the zonule is colored. Common eye-colors include: pale-blue, orange, crimson, onyx, violet and jade; though many other colors are known to occur. Most have either raven black, or pale reflections of human hair colors. For reasons unknown, a large number of half-drow are hairless from birth.\n\nSociety:\nNot inherently evil by nature, Half-Drow are subjected, by their Drow masters, to cruel savagery every bit as vile as the torments visited upon the subject people from which they where forcibly conceived. Their lot is perhaps worse than that of those the Drow initially conquer, for they are not only are subject to such torments by the Drow, but also deeply reviled by subjugates from which they sprang. Half-Drow often find themselves believing that subjugated races have it easy: should they escape their masters, they are welcomed into the surrounding free-lands. Half-Drow, however, resembling the Drow as much as they do, receive no such welcome: instead they seem destined to be slaves, or wandering sojourners: strangers in a strange land, no matter how far from their Drow slavers they flee.\n\nHalf-Drow consider the ingestion of wine mingled with Drow poison to be something of a sacrament. It is to them a sign of defiance, and is often followed by prayers and supplications to the divine for deliverance. As a result of generations of half-drow ingesting the poison, they have grown largely resistant to its effects.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Races of Faerun" compset="Race">

  <thing id="rShade" name="Shade" description="{b}Region{/B}: Anauroch.\n\nOver two thousand years ago, the ruler of a Netherese flying city transported his entire city onto the Plane of Shadow in order to explore that dim and perilous plane. For thousands of \n1372 DR it abruptly returned to Faer&#251;n above the Dire Wood.\n\nToday it soars above the deserts of Anauroch, land that was once a fertile part of the Empire of Netheril. Why the Netherese&#151;now known as the Shadovars&#151;returned, and what they are planning, are two mysteries that trouble the rulers of every nation in Faer&#251;n. Most fear that solving these vital riddles will provide them with answers they will not care to hear. Until then, the Shadovars scheme in secret, their true goals a mystery to all but their ruler, the High Prince Telamont, and his twelve sons, the Princes of Shade.\n\nNot all Shadovars are shades. The Princes of Shade decide who is to be given such a blessing, and they are stingy with their favors, careful to only empower those who are sure to be loyal \nto them and their causes. Prospective candidates are stringently tested for ability, loyalty, and resourcefulness.\n\nShades look just like normal humanoids, although their skin is gray to inky black, as are their eyes. They are thinner than most humans, and they prefer to dress in dark-hued clothes or armor. Human Shadovars are never made into shades until after they have reached the age of majority. There are no such things as young shades, and shades who marry produce normal offspring.\n\nShades have extraordinarily long lifespans. By trading some portion of their souls for the stuff of shadow, they extend their lifespans tenfold. Shades created from humans use the following \naging effect characteristics instead of the ones in Table 6&#150;5 in the Player&#146;s Handbook:\n\nShade (human) 300 450 600 +6d% years\n\n{b}History{/b}\nWhile the City of Shade was trapped in the Plane of Shadow for the past two millennia, the High Prince, most powerful wizard in the city, struck upon a means of transforming himself and his most loyal followers into creatures of shadow. This granted them nearimmortality and an incredible array of powers&#151;as long as they were shrouded in some kind of darkness.\n\nSince the return of the City of Shade to Faer&#251;n, the High Prince has pursued a mysterious agenda that few outside the Princes of Shade understand. Some things are clear, however, like the fact that the High Prince intends to exterminate the phaerimm who still remain in Anauroch after all these years. This crusade even caused the High Prince to lend his city&#146;s power to aid the people of Evereska in defeating a recent phaerimm invasion, granting the elvish community a strange bedfellow indeed. With the routing of the phaerimm, of course, the alliance ended, and the Shadovars have returned to their standoffish ways.\n\n{b}Outlook{/b}\nShades live to serve the High Prince and their fellow Shadovars. Most have grown up in the City of Shade as loyal champions of the High Prince&#146;s regime. While individual shades may have personal agendas, few conflict with the purposes of Shade&#146;s rulers, since disobedient or disloyal Shadovars are not likely to have been transformed into shades in the first place.\n\nShades consider themselves superior to all nonshades around them. After all, that&#146;s what they&#146;ve been raised to believe from birth. Only the most worthy Shadovars are chosen to become shades.\n\nMost shades go adventuring only at the behest of their superiors. They are normally given specific orders about what they are to do on such missions. Shades rarely share their true reasons for adventuring with any non-Shadovar allies they may temporarily make. They do not trust those outside Shade, and any relationships they strike up with strangers are sure to be temporary.\n\n{b}Shade Society{/b}\nLife in the City of Shade fits into a strictly controlled hierarchy. The High Prince sits at the top of the hierarchy&#146;s pyramid, with his sons&#151;the Twelve Princes of Shade&#151;right below him. Beneath them, the arcanists (Shadovar sorcerers and wizards) stand, with the military next down in importance. At the base of the pyramid, there are four levels of commoners. In descending order, these are the crafters (skilled laborers), the merchants (those who distribute necessary goods throughout the City of Shade and import and export needed materials), the servants (those who work as personal servants to people above them), and the slaves (who do the worst of the society&#146;s grunt work).\n\nAt the age of ascension (13 years old), every citizen is tutored in basic spellcraft and subjected to a battery of tests to determine how his skills can best serve the City of Shade. Then, at the age of majority (18 years old) each person embarks upon the job for which he was trained. Unless the person suddenly displays a new aptitude, he works at his designated career until the day he dies.\n\nThose citizens who prove to be especially important and loyal are transformed into shades. This is one of the greatest honors a Shadovar can receive. Only a small percentage of Shadovars are transformed, and commoners and low-ranking military officers are never chosen for transformation.\n\nOutside the City of Shade, most shades keep to themselves. They may travel singly or in small groups, but any alliances they make with non- Shadovars&#151;which are rare&#151;are sure to be alliances of convenience. Only a Prince of Shade or a Shadovar officer of captain&#146;s rank or higher can leave the City of Shade without an escort, and such a person had better have a defensible reason for doing so.\n\n{b}Language and Literacy{/b}\nNetherese is the language of the City of Shade, and all Shadovar speak it. Those who deal with other Faer&#251;nians or frequently travel outside the city often speak Common and whatever other languages they might find convenient.\n\nAll shades are literate, except for barbarians (not that any Shadovars could be considered barbarians).\n\n{b}Sources:{/b} {i}Races of Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.0 Edition and {i}Monsters of Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.5 Edition" compset="Race">

  <thing id="rKirlanan" name="Kir-Lanan" description="Falsely labeled gargoyles by some, kir-lanans are actually creatures who arrived on Faer&#251;n during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR). They have made it their mission to destroy the gods of Toril by first executing all who believe in them. In a world in which religion plays a central part in the lives of so many people, this is a no small task. It essentially calls for the murder of just about every person on the face of the planet.\n\nKir-lanans are only vaguely similar to true gargoyles. They have a humanoid form and large, batlike wings. They stand about 6 feet tall and weigh around 220 pounds. Their finely scaled hides are all dark in color, normally ranging from midnight blue through deep purple to black. Some rare individuals come in deep crimson, emerald, dun, or gray colors instead. They all have mouths full of sharp, pointed teeth, and they have small, blunt horns just above their temples. They eschew traditional clothing, instead binding their torsos with cloth wrappings interwoven with strips of metal, ivory, or stone.\n\nKir-lanan have no established life expectancy or age categories, as the oldest members of the race are only about 15 years of age. They are fully grown within one year of birth, and as yet show no signs of deterioration from aging. How long their lifespans are likely to be, none can say.\n\n{b}History{/b}\nEven the most learned souls of Faer&#251;n have few clues as to the true nature of kir-lanans. All they know for sure is that the creatures are bent upon killing off priests and other divine servants&#151;or &#147;godslaves,&#148; as the kirlanans call them&#151;as quickly as possible. The kir-lanans are the source of a great deal of rumor in Faer&#251;n these days. Anywhere there squats a stone gargoyle, people whisper that it&#146;s actually one of these evil beasts watching silently over a town, waiting for its brethren to arrive so they can strike. These creatures are reputed to have all sorts of powers, including a complete immunity to magic (not true) and the ability to drain the strength from their foes (true at least in part).\n\nThere are several credible theories as to where the kirlanans come from. The most popular is that the creatures hail from another world or plane composed entirely of negative energy, but in truth the kir-lanans sprang whole from the ineffable energies unleashed by the death of three gods: Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul. This trio of ill-fated deities were slain during the Time of Troubles, and their passing manifested itself in a number of various destructive acts. Some of that energy didn&#146;t simply dissipate as the dead deities passed from Toril. Instead, it coalesced in some deep, secret chamber into a seething ball of furious chaos. The first of the kir-lanans erupted from this dangerous sphere, fully formed and aware of its terrible origins. Several hundred kir-lanans came into being in this way. However, due to the manner of their creation, they were forsaken by the gods, and they knew it. They were doomed to never be able to gain the favor of the divine and pass into the afterlife. Instead, their deaths would literally be the end of them.\n\nAngered by this painful fact, the soulless kir-lanans decided that if the gods were to condemn them outright, then they would do the same to the gods. Unable to directly match the power of the gods, the creatures decided to instead attack the deities in the only way they could: through those who worshiped the gods of Toril. In the years since their arrival in Faer&#251;n, the kir-lanans have made good on their plans to wreak terror in the hearts of those who have promised their souls to the gods. They originally started with raids on clerics and adepts and their houses of worship, but in recent years they have extended their horrific campaign to include all worshipers in those temples, churches, or chapels. The threat the kir-lanans pose to the people of Faer&#251;n grows every day.\n\n{b}Outlook{/b}\nKir-lanans don&#146;t care much for life&#151;their own or that of anyone else. They exist solely to cause misery for the gods and those who call upon these feckless and fickle deities.\n\nKir-lanans are born in secluded rookeries and raised by all the adult kirlanans who call the place home. They come into the world only three months after conception, and they are fully grown within a matter of only one year. During this painfully short childhood, these new kirlanans are indoctrinated in the hatred that their elders hold for the gods. By the time these new adults are ready to stretch their wings, they bear as much hatred toward the deities who have damned them as any other kir-lanan. \n\nSome rare kir-lanans do not spend their days slaughtering the followers of the gods. Instead, they observe the actions of the people of Faer&#251;n from a distance, hoping to learn their strengths and weaknesses. They then bring this newfound knowledge back to their people so that the kirlanans can figure out a better way to murder people more efficiently.\n\n{b}KIR-LANAN CHARACTERS{/b}\nKir-lanans favor the fighter class, as this&#151;along with their innate abilities&#151;gives them the chance to do the most damage to the largest number of hapless believers at any given time.\nSpells run out, but claws keep killing forever. They most often multiclass as fighter/sorcerers or fighter/necromancers. They can manipulate arcane energies just fine, and their nature lends itself to handling negative energies.\n\n{b}Kir-Lanan Society{/b}\nLife as a kir-lanan is relentlessly harsh. They exist only to kill, to breed, and to learn how to become better at killing. Both male and females are treated equally in kir-lanan society. This is a meritocracy. The strongest rule, no matter who they are.\n\nMost kir-lanans wander about the world in wings of two to five creatures. These wings rarely have a stable roster, with kirlanans joining and leaving as the mood suits them. The leaders \nof these wings are chosen by combat, and those who are not the leaders constantly jockey to be in the right position to challenge the leader the moment she leaves herself vulnerable. Wings of kir-lanans mount their operations out of breeding grounds known as rookeries. At certain times of the year&#151;based on a schedule of which only the kir-lanans are aware&#151;individual members of a wing leave their fellows and travel back to their rookeries to breed.\n\nOther than the members of these wings, there are two others positions in kir-lanan culture: the valrak and the kivar. Both of these vocations stand outside the traditional structure of the wing, allowing the valraks and kivars to avoid the normal rivalry for leadership that causes so many of the wings to waste time and energy on internal struggles. The attention of the kir-lanans would be better spent on taking the battle to the believers, and it&#146;s the duty of the valraks and kivars to help direct this. \n\nThe word &#147;valrak&#148; means &#147;eye&#148; in the guttural kir-lanan tongue. These creatures travel around Faer&#251;n individually, watching the native peoples and learning everything they can about them and their rich and complex history. By doing this, the valraks free up the others to cause as much destruction as they can, while the valraks scout out new victims and locations. &#147;Kivar,&#148; on the other hand, means &#147;voice.&#148; The kivars are a combination of morale officers and strategic planners for the kirlanans. Although they spend most of their time in the field, exhorting the wings to attempt greater and more terrible acts of destruction, when back at the rookery the kivars gather to absorb and discuss the information gathered by the valraks. They use this to guide the kir-lanan campaign against the gods. Kivars also are the ones who negotiate temporary alliances with other groups of people who are less devout in their worship of the gods. Of course, once these allies have served their purposes, they are to be murdered as well, but the kivars are willing to let them serve their purpose for a time.\n\nNew kir-lanans are born in these rookeries and raised by the kivars. Once they are one year or so in age, they are released into the wild and sent to join up with a new wing or to reinforce an old one. No one knows what happens to kir-lanans as they get older. The eldest ones are only 15 years old, and many of those who were part of the race&#146;s creation have been killed off by either their intended victims or in leadership challenges.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Races of Faerun" compset="Race">

  <thing id="fTattooMag" name="Tattoo Magic" description="You can create tattoos that store spells.\n\n{b}Prerequisite:{/b} Craft (calligraphy) or Craft (painting) skill, spellcaster level 3rd.\n\n{b}Benefit:{/b} You can create single-use magic tattoos. You can create a tattoo of any spell of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets a creature or creatures. Creating a tattoo takes 1 hour, and it must be inked onto a creature with a corporeal body. When you create a tattoo, you set the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a tattoo is its spell level &#215; its caster level &#215; 50 gp. To create a tattoo, you must spend 1/25th of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price.\n\nWhen you create a tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. The bearer of the tattoo is the only one who can activate it and is always the target of the spell. Activating a tattoo requires the creature to touch the tattoo with either hand (the hand does not need to be empty). Activating a tattoo is a standard action that does not draw an attack of opportunity.\n\nAny tattoo that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the tattoo.\n\nNormally, a magic tattoo uses a magic item space on the creature&#146;s body. For example, a creature with a tattoo on one of its hands could not gain the benefit from a magic glove on that hand. Likewise, a creature with a magic tattoo on its back does not receive the benefits of a magic cloak, cape, or mantle. In effect, the magic tattoo is always the first item &#147;worn&#148; on that part of the body, negating the effects of all other items. A tattoo can be created that does not use a magic item space, but the base price of such a tattoo is double the normal value.\n\nA magic tattoo can be erased with an erase spell as if it were magic writing. Failing to erase the tattoo does not activate it.\n\nWhen a tattoo is activated, the ink pattern or design vanishes from the bearer&#146;s skin.\n\n{b}Source:{/b} {i}Races of Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.0 Edition" compset="Feat" summary="Can imbue single-use spells onto a body with a Tattoo.">

A heavy aspergillum can hold up to 3 flasks of holy water. In addition to serving as a common aspergillum, it can also be used in melee combat. When a button on the shaft is pressed, tiny holes open in the mace head, allowing holy water to touch a creature struck by the weapon. Each use of the weapon in this manner uses one flask of holy water per attack whether or not the attack is successful. If the wielder has multiple attacks per round with the weapon, the holy water can be released multiple times in one round (but no more than once per attack) until it is depleted. A heavy aspergillum may also be used to make ranged touch attacks with holy water in the manner of a normal aspergillum.\nPouring a flask of holy water into an aspergillum or heavy aspergillum is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity." compset="Weapon">

The harpooned creature moves at only half speed and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the harpooned creature can only move within thelimits that the rope allows (the trailing rope is 30 feet long). If the harpooned creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15) or fail, losing the spell.\n\nThe harpooned creature can pull the harpoon from its wound if it has two free hands and takes a full-round action to do so, but in so doing it deals damage to itself equal to the initial damage the harpoon caused (in other words, the damage coming out equals the damage going in).  For example, if you hit with a harpoon and deal 8 points of damage, the target takes another 8 points of damage when it removes the harpoon.

A \nvictim caught in a footsaw trap can move at half speed if the device is not attached to another object (such as to a tree or boulder by a length of chain). If it is attached in such a fashion, the victim must break the attachment, otherwise he cannot move.\n\nThe trap inflicts an additional 1d4 points of damage from the saw blades every round that a trapped victim takes any action that involves movement. A trapped creature can pry open the jaws of the trap and escape (Strength check DC 25) or loose himself with an Escape Artist check (DC 30). Failure means that the trap deals another 1d4 points of damage to the victim and that the victim remains trapped.\n\nA footsaw trap is a CR 2 trap.

  <thing id="sWizShadCa" name="Shadow Canopy" description="You create a field of shadow. The outer surface of the field is impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, granting 100% concealment to creatures and objects within the spell&#146;s area. A creature under the effect of blacklight cannot see through the field. The interior of the field casts a deep shadow on everything within, reducing normal vision to 5 feet; creatures with darkvision can see normally within the field. Light, including sunlight, cannot penetrate the field. Creatures that would normally be adversely affected by sunlight, such as shades and vampires, are able to function normally within the field.\nYou can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless you cast it on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance to resist this spell.\nShadow canopy counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level. Light spells of equal level have no effect on shadow canopy, but light spells of higher level counter or dispel \nshadow canopy.\n\n{b}Material Component:{/b} A handful of coal dust and the dried eyeball of any diurnal creature." compset="Spell">
