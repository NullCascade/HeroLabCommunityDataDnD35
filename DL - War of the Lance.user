The ritual lasts 8 continuous hours and is a very delicate procedure. Should you be interrupted, all Concentration checks have their standard DCs increased by 15. Failure causes you not only to fail at conducting the ritual, but to take 1d4 points of Constitution damage per egg that would otherwise be transformed. The eggs themselves blacken and die, killing the dragon fetus inside without creating any draconians. You can also automatically choose to create any amount of draconians less than the normal base amount per egg. If this brings the number of draconians down to less than half the normal amount, the ritual only lasts 4 hours.\n\nFor every three caster levels you possess above 10th level, you contribute a +1 creation bonus to the pool of creation points (see below) that you can use to enhance the draconians created.\n\n{i}Note{/i}: See Chapter Two for rules related to the creation of draconians." compset="Feat" summary="You can take part in the Draconian Creation Ritual." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="cMaster" name="Master" description="The professional expert forms the bulk of Krynn&#146;s population, but it is the master who truly embodies the pursuit of excellence in a craft, trade, or a particular field of knowledge. Masters are exceptional individuals whose works are often destined to leave their mark on the world and whose skills become renowned in history. Theros Ironfeld, Sebastius of the Players of Gilean, Otik Sandath, and Bertrem the Aesthetic are all examples of Krynn&#146;s master craftsmen, performers, professionals, and sages.\n\n{b}Adventures{/b}: Masters are inevitably caught up in the whirlwind of heroic adventures, not only because their works are valued by other heroes, but because their fate is closely tied to that of the world. A master often seeks out adventure as a means of learning more about his chosen profession, or because his skills take him to places where important events are happening. Master performers, especially, are often itinerant individuals, never staying in one place for long, so the road is their home.\n\n{b}Characteristics{/b}: Masters are primarily dedicated to improving and mastering their skills and acquiring feats which accentuate and develop their capabilities. Because their primary focus determines their later options, the specific skills and feats the masters choose will affect their fate.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: A master has no particular tendency towards any moral or ethical point of view, although many show at least a neutral component to their alignment, since their focus tends to remain on their craft. Thus extremes of alignment are rare.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Masters tend to drift towards a deity that reflects their primary focus and their point of view. Good masters often revere Majere (craftsmen, professionals, and sages), or Branchala (performers). Neutral masters honor Gilean (sages and performers), Sirrion (performers), Shinare (professionals), or Reorx (craftsmen). Evil masters pay homage to Sargonnas (craftsmen) or Hiddukel (sages, professionals, and performers).\n\n{b}Background{/b}: Most masters begin their careers as apprentices to other masters, performing acts of drudgery or labor as youths and building up a steady comprehension of the realities of their chosen path. At an early age, those who have the talent and commitment to advancing their studies are often inducted into guilds or, in the case of master sages, are accepted into libraries and houses of learning. The adult life of masters commences when they have achieved their most basic understanding of their primary focus and are ready to go out into the world as journeymen in their field.\n\n{b}Races{/b}: Masters arise among all of the civilized races of Krynn. Each race tends to favor one of the four types of master above the others, except for the multi-talented humans, who embrace them all. Dwarves are more likely to become master craftsmen, elves are more often master sages, and kender produce an uncommon amount of master performers. Gnomes produce many master craftsmen, professionals, and sages, but few, if any, master performers.\n\n{b}Other Classes{/b}: Masters get along with most of the other classes, who depend upon them for quality work, information, and support. They get along best with skilled classes, such as bards, mariners, nobles and rogues. Master sages also favor clerics and wizards for their scholarly aspects.\n\n{b}Role{/b}: Like the bard, noble, or rogue, masters are supporting characters, not front-line combatants. The masters&#146; choices of skills and feats makes a big difference in how they fit into a group; masters prove their mettle by backing up the other classes, or by making use of individual skills in non-combat situations." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

The spell does not allow you and the target to share thoughts, although when both are sharing the same view, there is a sense of awareness you are not alone.\n\nViewing the world through someone else&#146;s gaze is confusing, requiring concentration. Either you or the target can choose to share sight by closing your eyes and focusing. The focusing individual sees through the other&#146;s eyes, seeing everything the other is seeing. Visual capabilities (such as darkvision or low-light vision) are as per the character physically present at the scene. For example, if a human is using share sight with a dwarf, whenever the human views through the dwarf &#146;s eyes, he&#146;ll see things clearly with the dwarf &#146;s natural darkvision; conversely, if the dwarf looks through the human&#146;s eyes, he&#146;s limited by the human&#146;s lack of darkvision.\n\nAlthough share sight does not allow direct communication, per se, the awareness that one is sharing with the other does enable rudimentary communication. Writing something and reading it, or utilizing sign language, or other such visual means of communication can enable the passing of information from one person to another, although share sight does not necessarily convey understanding. In the previous example with the human and the dwarf, if the dwarf writes a note when he knows the human is sharing vision, he can pass a message. However, if that note is written in dwarvish, and the human does not speak dwarven, then the message is wasted, as the sharing is purely visual.\n\nOnce the spell has been cast upon the subject, the distance between you and the subject does not affect the spell as long as you both are on the same plane of existence. If either of you leave the plane, or die, the spell immediately ceases to function.\n\n{i}Focus{/i}: A monocle set in a platinum frame, worth at least 100 stl." compset="Spell" summary="You and target can see through each other&apos;s eyes when concentrate, no communication or auditory input">

The spell does not allow you and the target to share thoughts, although when both are sharing the same view, there is a sense of awareness you are not alone.\n\nViewing the world through someone else&#146;s gaze is confusing, requiring concentration. Either you or the target can choose to share sight by closing your eyes and focusing. The focusing individual sees through the other&#146;s eyes, seeing everything the other is seeing. Visual capabilities (such as darkvision or low-light vision) are as per the character physically present at the scene. For example, if a human is using share sight with a dwarf, whenever the human views through the dwarf &#146;s eyes, he&#146;ll see things clearly with the dwarf &#146;s natural darkvision; conversely, if the dwarf looks through the human&#146;s eyes, he&#146;s limited by the human&#146;s lack of darkvision.\n\nAlthough share sight does not allow direct communication, per se, the awareness that one is sharing with the other does enable rudimentary communication. Writing something and reading it, or utilizing sign language, or other such visual means of communication can enable the passing of information from one person to another, although share sight does not necessarily convey understanding. In the previous example with the human and the dwarf, if the dwarf writes a note when he knows the human is sharing vision, he can pass a message. However, if that note is written in dwarvish, and the human does not speak dwarven, then the message is wasted, as the sharing is purely visual.\n\nOnce the spell has been cast upon the subject, the distance between you and the subject does not affect the spell as long as you both are on the same plane of existence. If either of you leave the plane, or die, the spell immediately ceases to function.\n\n{i}Focus{/i}: A monocle set in a platinum frame, worth at least 100 stl." compset="Spell" summary="You and target can see through each other&apos;s eyes when concentrate, no communication or auditory input">

Once a day, you can produce a single-use item which duplicates the effects of any 0-level wizard spell as a full round action. The effective caster level of this device, cobbled together from spare parts and doodads you have in your toolbelt, is equal to your class level. At 5th level, you can produce two 0-level items per day or may produce a single-use item, which duplicates the effects of any 1st-level wizard spell once per day. At 8th level, you can produce three 0-level items, two 1st-level items, or one 2nd-level item per day.\n\nOnly you can use these MacGuffins, and others cannot duplicate them. Once used, they are rendered inert. MacGuffins are not magical, even though they duplicate magical effects, and thus spell resistance and anti-magic effects do not affect them. Other defenses against these effects, such as energy resistance, retain their usual effectiveness.\n\nMacGuffins use up tool points like kitbash items and contraptions, and if you wish to continue using this ability, you must maintain a well-stocked toolbelt. Each MacGuffin uses 1 tool point + one point per spell level. If you are bound, paralyzed, or otherwise helpless, you cannot use this ability, nor can you if ethereal or otherwise unable to get to your toolbelt and equipment. \n\nAs with most gnomish devices, your MacGuffin almost always does something you did not intend for it to do.

Beginning at 1st level, you may make a DC 20 Craft (tinkering) check in order to coax greater performance out of an item. Items so improved gain an enhancement bonus to any relevant skill checks, attack rolls, or saving throw DCs of up to the gnomish tinker&#146;s class level. This bonus does not stack with other enhancement bonuses, such as from a masterwork or magic item. Any character other than the gnomish tinker must make a DC 15 Craft (tinkering) or DC 20 Disable Device check in order to figure out how to make it work at its new improved performance rate. A natural roll of 1 on such a check renders the item useless until repaired.\n\nThe time spent making the improvement is equal to 10 minutes per point of enhancement bonus; subtract 5 minutes for every 5 points the Craft (tinkering) check exceeds the DC (minimum 5 minutes). Improvements require a number of tool points (see Gnome Toolbelt sidebar) equal to one tenth of the item&#146;s cost and last a number of hours equal to the gnomish tinker&#146;s Intelligence bonus (if positive) before losing their bonus. Working without tools incurs a &#150;4 penalty to the Craft (tinkering) check, while masterwork tools grant a +2 bonus.\n\nIf you fail your Craft (tinkering) check, you only take half as long as you would have spent if you had succeeded but tool points must still be met. In addition, the item in question must make a saving throw (DC 10 + gnomish tinker&#146;s ranks in Craft [tinkering]) or become useless until repaired.\n\nUnless your Craft (tinkering) check is an amazing success (10 or more points higher than the target DC), you must also make a roll on the quirks section of the Quirks and Mishaps table (RoA 146)." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Provide temp enhancement bonus to items up to Tinker level, may gain a quirk">
