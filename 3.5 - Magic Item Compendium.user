At its base is an intricately carved metal representation of a stern, bearded face. \n\nThis weapon was created to aid the followers of St. Cuthbert in exacting just retribution for wrongful acts. When you wield a cudgel that never forgets, it functions as a +1 axiomatic heavy mace if you are lawful neutral, lawful good, or neutral.\n\n{b}Relic Power{/b}: If you have established the proper divine connection, this weapon reveals its intelligence and sentience (AL LN; Int 16, Wis 10, Cha 16; Ego 12; speech [Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal], darkvision 60 ft., hearing, Intimidate 10 ranks for a total modifier of +13). In  addition, the mace can produce a cure moderate wounds effect three times per day.\n\nTo use the relic power, you must worship St. Cuthbert and either sacrifice a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD. If you sacrifice a 7th-level divine slot (or you have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD), the cudgel also remembers which foes have struck you and deals extra damage to them in retribution thereafter, if an enemy hits you with a weapon (including a natural  weapon), the cudgel thereafter has an enhancement bonus 2 higher than normal against that foe. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against that foe. No disguise or shapechanging ability can guard against this ability.\n\nA cudgel that never forgets speaks little except during combat, during which it reminds you in stentorian tones about the transgressions of each enemy, whether it has witnessed them personally (&quot;That bugbear hath wounded Lidda most grievously&quot;) or simply assumed  wrongdoing based on creature type (&quot;That succubus hath surely tempted many good men toward evil&quot;). The imprecations of a cudgel that never forgets count as an attempt to demoralize an opponent with the Intimidate skill (PH 76). Unless it&apos;s healing you, a cudgel attempts to demoralize an opponent every round during your turn.\n\n{b}Lore{/b}: The first cudgel that never forgets was crafted by a masterweaponsmith whose city was plagued by shapeshifters that attacked citizens, then disappeared into crowds. A select group of city guards, armed with the cudgels, quickly sorted out the guilty from the innocent and restored order to the city. Thereafter, the cudgels were donated to the Church of St. Cuthbert (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).\n\nPrice (Item Level): 20,312 gp (15th)\nBody Slot: &#151; (held)\nCaster Level: 20th\nAura: Strong; (DC 25) conjuration\nActivation: &#151;; see text\nWeight: 8 lb.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Sanctify Relic, cure moderate wounds, true seeing.\n{b}Cost to Create{/b}: 10,000 gp (plus 312 gp for masterwork heavy mace), 800 XP, 20 days." compset="MagicWep">

  <thing id="iWaterWhip" name="Water Whip" description="\nThis strange weapon looks less like a traditional whip and more like a tube of water, tapering along its length to icicle sharpness at one end. \nThe handle is crafted from a pale blue crystal shard. \n\nThis +1 whip shimmers and undulates with deceptive grace when held. Unlike a normal whip, a water whip deals lethal damage and can  effect armored creatures.\n\nFurthermore, while wielding a water whip you are difficult to disarm. If the whip is knocked from your grasp, it immediately flows back into your hand at the beginning of your next turn (even if it is within someone else&apos;s grasp) as long as it is within 30 feet of you. \nDoing this requires no action on your part. In addition, drawing a water whip is always a free action.\n\nBoth a fire elemental and water elemental are bound within a water whip, allowing it to emanate either of two energy properties, flaming or frost (DMG 224). You choose the property when you activate the whip, and it deals an extra 1d6 points of the appropriate kind of damage (fire\nor cold). \n\n{b}Lore{/b}: The first water whip was created by a sahuagin druid named Ak&apos;ash&apos;eck, who roamed the fringes of a great reef a decade ago  (Knowledge [history] DC 20).\n\nAk&apos;ash&apos;eck enjoyed preying on unwary folk sailing south to trade with other sahuagin. He was famous for the trick of ensnaring a victim near the railing of a ship passing at night, then pulling the victim overboard before an alarm could be raised (Knowledge [history] DC 30). \n\nPrice (Item Level): 20,301 gp (15th)\nBody Slot: &#151; (held)\nCaster Level: 8th\nAura: Moderate; (DC 19) transmutation\nActivation: &#151; and standard (command)\nWeight: 2 lb.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Bind Elemental (ECS 51) or Craft Magic Arms and Armor, planar binding.\n{b}Cost to Create{/b}: 10,000 (plus 301 gp for masterwork whip), 800 XP, 20 days." compset="MagicWep">

A {i}true seeing{/i} spell reveals the presence of the hidden pockets but not the command word needed to open them.\n\nEven when a pocket is full, it never bulges, so a {i}belt of hidden pouches{/i} stuffed with 150 pounds of items still looks like an ordinary belt.\n\nTo place any object in the belt, you merely press the object into the belt. Doing so while speaking the command word places the object in one of the hidden pockets (if one of them is empty). Placing an item in a pocket (hidden or visible) is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\nNaming a stored object and speaking a second command word draws the named object out of the belt and places it in your hand. Doing this is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\nYou can also reach into one of the ten regular hidden pockets and draw out an item, just as if retrieving a stored object (a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity).\n\nA casual search won&#146;t reveal any objects placed in the belt, and searching the visible pockets cannot reveal anything stored in the hidden pockets. It is possible to use a Sleight of Hand check to pluck something out of one of the ten visible pockets, but only someone wearing or holding a belt can access the hidden pockets, and then only with the correct command word.\n\n{i}Prerequisites{/i}: Craft Wondrous Item, {i}Leomund&#146;s secret chest{/i}.\n\n{i}Cost to Create{/i}: 2,500 gp, 200 XP, 5 days." compset="Wondrous">

You can activate a {i}desperation chain{/i} when you are being rendered helpless by an enemy (such as being pinned, paralyzed, or dropped to &#150;1 or fewer hit points). When you activate the chain, you can cast a single arcane spell of 3rd level or lower without spending an additional action to do so. Doing this expends the prepared spell or spell slot as if you had cast the spell. The chosen spell must have a casting time no longer than 1 full round. Casting a spell in this way requires no verbal or somatic components and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You must still provide any material components or focus required, as well as pay any XP or other costs of the spell.\n\nThe spell you cast takes effect after the effect that rendered you helpless (so it can&#146;t prevent that effect), though it could theoretically neutralize or reverse it. For example, a bard wearing the chain could cast {i}cure light wounds{/i} in response to being reduced to &#150;3 hit points.\n\nThis ability functions once per day.\n\nYou must wear a {i}desperation chain{/i} for 24 hours before you can access its abilities.

A single ruby set in its center flickers and pulses with magical energy.{/i}\n\nA {i}ring of greater counterspells{/i} can hold a spell of 1st through 6th level, much like a {i}ring of counterspells{/i}. You cannot cast a stored spell out of the ring, but should that spell ever be cast upon you, it is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on your part. This use causes the ruby stone to flash once and uses up the stored spell. Once it is gone, a new spell (or the same one as before) can be placed into the ring.\n\nIf you are a spellcaster capable of countering a spell on your own, you can also access the ring&#146;s secondary ability. Once per day as an immediate action, you can attempt to counter a single spell cast by a spellcaster you can see, provided he is within 100 feet. Like the ring&#146;s other ability, this one requires no preparation or knowledge on your part. You need not make a Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast, and the spell you use to counterspell can be of any level. This counterspell attempt functions like {i}greater dispel magic{/i} used to counter a spell, except that you add your caster level to the counterspell check (maximum +20). Thus, a 12th-level wizard wearing a {i}ring of greater counterspells{/i} would roll 1d20+12 when activating this ability. When you activate this secondary effect, the braids of white gold seem to twist and writhe on your finger, and the metal glows faintly is if it were growing hot, although you feel no heat.\n\n{i}Prerequisites{/i}: Forge Ring, {i}greater dispel magic{/i}, {i}imbue with spell ability{/i}.\n\n{i}Cost to Create{/i}: 8,000 gp, 640 XP, 16 days." compset="Ring">

A {i}spare hand{/i} can hold magic items such as wands and rods for easy access, but you cannot activate those items while they are so held. Transferring an item to or from a {i}spare hand{/i} is a free action.\n\nWhenever your {i}spare hand{/i} is not carrying an item, you gain a +2 competence bonus on Climb, Escape Artist, and grapple checks.

Once per round, you can command the hand to stow an item or retrieve a stowed item (including a weapon) as a free action.\n\nIf you instead expend a 2nd-level infusion, the {i}spare hand{/i} gains the above ability and can also hold a buckler or light shield, freeing your normal hand while still providing a bonus to AC from the shield. You still incur any armor check penalty or other drawbacks of holding the shield, and are subject to normal penalties if you are not proficient with the shield.\n\nIf you expend a 3rd-level infusion, a {i}spare hand{/i} gains all the above abilities and becomes capable of wielding a light weapon. You can command a {i}spare hand{/i} to make off-hand attacks with this weapon as if you were wielding it. A {i}spare hand{/i} attacks using your normal attack modifier plus any appropriate penalties for an off-hand attack.\n\nUsing an infusion to power a {i}spare hand{/i} requires 10 minutes and the expenditure of an infusion of the appropriate level.

When you wear one of these garments over armor, you and every ally within 20 feet gains a +1 morale bonus on saving throws, provided that you are lawful neutral, lawful good, lawful evil, or neutral. This is a continuous effect and requires no activation.\n\n{b}Relic Power{/b}: If you have established the proper divine connection, a {i}tabard of the great crusade{/i} also provides you with damage reduction 5/evil. Furthermore, any ally other than you who grasps the hem of the tabard (a move [manipulation] action) can gain the benefit of a {i}heal{/i} spell. This ability functions once per day.\n\nTo use the relic power, you must worship St. Cuthbert and either sacrifice an 8th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 15 HD.\n\n{b}Lore{/b}: Only seven of these tabards are known to exist. Originally made for an elite cadre of warrior-healers, they have since been passed down from one battlefield cleric to another (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).\n\n{i}Prerequisites{/i}: Craft Wondrous Item, Sanctify Relic, {i}heal{/i}.\n\n{i}Cost to Create{/i}: 2,750 gp, 220 XP, 6 days." compset="Wondrous">

This act requires but a moment&#146;s thought (a swift action), and can be repeated as often as desired throughout the day.\n\nSadly, these stories obviously have no basis in reality, for such an item would undoubtedly be prized above all others by any mage with the resources to craft one. Of course, as a thing of myth, the {i}vest of the archmagi{/i} can&#146;t be created.

Once it has been filled, it automatically starts burning the quartz dust, creating a cloud in a 20-foot radius emanation centered on you.

In each case, the cloud produced is the same size as the one produced by the quartz dust and behaves in the same way, except as noted on the table. You are always unaffected by the cloud created.\n\nTo use the relic power, you must worship Nerull and either sacrifice a divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and a minimum number of Hit Dice.

It is bound with a braided cord and secured with a medallion bearing the holy symbol of Wee Jas.{/i}\n\n{i}Scrolls of uncertain provenance{/i} are not spells stored in written form, but collections of death-obsessed writings in an unknown hand. Popular myth holds that those who can command the lore contained in a set of these scrolls have power over life and death. As long as you possess {i}scrolls of uncertain provenance{/i}, you gain a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge checks, provided that you are lawful neutral, lawful evil, lawful good, or neutral.\n\n{b}Relic Power{/b}: If you have established a proper divine connection, you can attempt to read from the scrolls once per day for 1 hour. Understanding their lore, however, is not an easy task. To begin with, the scrolls are written in nearly every language, ancient and modern, and the text sometimes switches languages within the same sentence. Thus, a successful hour of reading requires a successful DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check. You receive a +2 bonus on the check for every language you speak. So cryptic are the scrolls that even {i}read magic, {i}comprehend languages{/i}, or other spells don&#146;t help you understand them, nor does the Decipher Script skill.\n\n{b}Time &#151; Benefit{/b}\n1 hour &#151; {i}Renewal pact{/i} for yourself\n2 hours &#151; {i}Renewal pact{/i} for another\n3 hours &#151; {i}Death pact{/i} for yourself\n4 hours &#151; {i}Death pact{/i} for another\n6 hours &#151; {i}True resurrection{/i} for another (and the scrolls disappear)\n\nIf your check is successful, you gain temporary understanding of one of the scrolls&#146; secrets depending on how long you have spent reading them. Your hours of successful reading stack for this purpose, so you can read over multiple days to gain a greater benefit, if desired. The time spent need not all be spent at once; you can divide it as you choose for the purpose of gaining benefits.\n\nReading {i}scrolls of uncertain provenance{/i} is not without risk, since delving into their mysteries draws you near to the border between life and death. Whenever you spend an hour reading {i}scrolls of uncertain provenance{/i}, you must roll on the following table, whether or not you learn anything useful.\n\n{b}d% &#151; Effect{/b}\n01&#150;10 &#151; Go insane (as the {i}insanity{/i} spell); Will DC 20 negates.\n11&#150;30 &#151; The scrolls bestow a permanent curse upon you, applying a &#150;4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks; Will DC 20 negates.\n31&#150;60 &#151; Receive a {i}geas/quest{/i} to perform for Wee Jas; Will DC 20 negates.\n61&#150;90 &#151; Gain 1d6 negative levels (Fort DC 20 removes them after 24 hours).\n91&#150;100 &#151; Become a ghost for a year and a day; Fort DC 20 negates.\n\nTo use the relic power, you must worship Wee Jas and either sacrifice a 6th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 11 HD.\n\n{b}Lore{/b}: {i}Scrolls of uncertain provenance{/i} have long been associated with Wee Jas, although even her lorekeepers don&#146;t know where the first ones came from (Knowledge [religion] DC 15).\n\nIn fact, they were penned by beings that lost their sanity in the pursuit of arcane knowledge and collected by agents of Wee Jas for the sake of the knowledge they contain (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).\n\n{i}Prerequisites{/i}: Craft Wondrous Item, Sanctify Relic, {i}death pact{/i} (SC 60), {i}renewal pact{/i} (SC 173), {i}true resurrection{/i}.\n\n{i}Cost to Create{/i}: 4,000 gp, 320 XP, 8 days." compset="Wondrous">

The symbol must be covered completely to douse its light.\n\n{b}Relic Power{/b}: If you have established the proper divine connection, you can command a {i}shard of the sun{/i} to fire two simultaneous {i}searing light{/i} spells, though each must be aimed at a different target. Each beam deals 10d6 points of damage to undead, 5d6 points to constructs and objects, and 5d8 points of damage to other creatures. Creatures particularly vulnerable to bright light, such as vampires, take 10d8 points of damage from these beams. This ability functions three times per day.\n\nTo use the relic power, you must worship Pelor and either sacrifice a 6th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 11 HD. If you sacrifice an 8th-level spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 15 HD, you can fire four {i}searing light{/i} beams with each activation (no two at the same target).\n\n{b}Lore{/b}: The first {i}shards of the sun{/i} were hewn by Pelor himself from the orb of the sun and molded into the shape of his symbol. Over the centuries, he gifted them to his most favored high priests, and most of them remain in the hands of his clergy today (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).\n\n{i}Prerequisites{/i}: Craft Wondrous Item, Sanctify Relic, {i}daylight{/i}, {i}searing light{/i}.\n\n{i}Cost to Create{/i}: 1,750 gp, 140 XP, 4 days." compset="Wondrous">

If you are neutral evil, chaotic evil, lawful evil, or neutral, the book reveals full instructions for creating a lich&#146;s phylactery and offers 500 blank spell pages that function like those in {i}Boccob&#146;s blessed book{/i} (DMG 249).\n\n{b}Relic Power{/b}: A {i}tome of the stilled tongue{/i} also contains directions for eldritch mental exercises designed to strengthen your spellcasting. If you have established the proper divine connection and read the appropriate section of the tome (requiring 1 hour of mental exercises), you can increase your effective caster level for all spells by 1 for 24 hours. However, because the exercises are mystically strenuous, doing them reduces your full normal hit point total by 1 per character level while the caster level increase is in effect. This ability functions once per day.\n\nTo use the relic power, you must worship Vecna and either sacrifice a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD.\n\n{b}Lore{/b}: The grisly cover decoration on the original {i}tome of the stilled tongue{/i} once belonged to a former cleric of Vecna who couldn&#146;t keep her order&#146;s secrets. Now five copies are known to exist, but the origins of the other four tongues have never been revealed (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).\n\n{i}Prerequisites{/i}: Craft Wondrous Item, Sanctify Relic, Scribe Scroll, {i}secret page{/i}.\n\n{i}Cost to Create{/i}: 3,750 gp, 300 XP, 8 days." compset="Wondrous">
