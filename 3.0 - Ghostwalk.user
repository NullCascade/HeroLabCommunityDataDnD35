  <thing id="tmGWGhost" name="Ghost Template" description="A ghost is the semitangible soul of a creature that has died. Instead of a physical body made of muscle, bone, and blood, it has a ghost body made of transparent ectoplasm. Ghosts are not undead, although they are often mistaken for undead by the truly ignorant. They do not need to eat (although they can if they want to) or sleep as they did when alive. When a ghost is wounded, it leaks ectoplasm like a living creature leaks blood. \n\nIn general, a ghost appears as it did at the moment its physical body died, although some ghosts learn how to reshape their ectoplasm and alter their appearance. A ghost body is made of transparent ectoplasm, and an alert observer can easily recognize the identity of the ghost and that the ghost is not a physical person. \n\nMost ghosts try to get their bodies raised from the dead (which causes the ghost to merge with the physical body) or search for whoever was responsible for their death, while others become ghosts willingly to pursue some goal or escape some terrible punishment. They otherwise have the same memories and personality they did when they were alive.\n\n&#147;Ghost&#148; is an acquired template that can be applied to any living humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the character). The creature&#146;s type changes to outsider (incorporeal). It uses all the character&#146;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Ghostwalk Campaign Source" compset="Template" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cEidolon" name="Eidolon" description="The terrifying haunt, the spirit that rots, the raging poltergeist, the body thief&#151;all are kinds of eidolons. Eidolons may be guardian spirits, evil haunts, or adventurers of any type. Some are benign and use their abilities to help others, while others delve into the darker portions of the soul and emerge twisted and profane. Eidolons that are not adventurers may be any sort of person, from a powerful sorcerer to a humble cleric to a greedy mercenary to a common farmer.\n\n{b}Adventures{/b}: Many eidolons see their nature as just another aspect of existence and follow the same goals they had while alive, including adventuring. Others become eidolons only temporarily, forced down this path either when their bodies cannot be raised or when they must remain after dying to take care of unfinished business.\n\n{b}Characteristics{/b}: Eidolons have excellent fighting ability, even though they gain no additional proficiencies in weapons or armor (which are often useless for incorporeal creatures anyway). The greatest benefit of the eidolon class is the rapid acquisition of ghost feats, which allow each individual ghost to progress along a particular path toward advanced ghost abilities. Even nonfighters are helped by advancing in this class because of its good Will saving throw bonus and useful class skills.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: Eidolons may be of any alignment. Good eidolons are often benign entities who try to aid others or combat the undead. Lawful eidolons often work to protect the rights of ghosts in general or improve relations between ghosts and the living. Chaotic eidolons may be pranksters or opportunists, using their new abilities for personal gain simply because they can. Evil eidolons tend to be dangerous and malevolent spirits who seek revenge upon the living.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Most eidolons worship whatever deity they did in life, although most also revere Aluvan, protector of souls. Some who are intent on entering the True Afterlife pay homage to Dracanish so that the body and soul may be properly united in death. Most ghosts hate and fear Orcus, for worshipers of this foul deity often steal waiting bodies while their ghosts are away, making it difficult to return to life or gain their final peace in the afterlife.\n\n{b}Background{/b}: All eidolons originate in the same manner&#151;a person spends enough time as a ghost and eventually develops ghost abilities. Ghosts have a community of their own, for the bonds of death transcend race, nationality, or any other aspects of a person&#146;s background or personality. They tend to make friends among other ghosts who died in a similar way or with those who are on the same path of ghost powers.\n\n{b}Races{/b}: Because only humanoids can become ghosts under normal circumstances, almost all eidolons are humanoids. Eidolons come from all walks of life, regardless of race; no race is more likely to become a ghost than any other, and no race has a tradition of following certain paths over others.\n\n{b}Other Classes{/b}: Although possessing amazing abilities, an eidolon must sometimes rely upon the skills of others. Eidolons are decent fighters, but lack the specific training of a fighter. Their spellcasting ability does not improve after death, so a live spellcaster of equal experience is usually their better. While an eidolon might be sneaky when incorporeal, a manifested eidolon is no match for the quiet and skill of a true rogue.\n\n{b}Abilities{/b}: Wisdom and Charisma are especially important for eidolons, because many ghost feats rely on these ability scores, and Charisma determines the ghost&#146;s natural deflection bonus when it is incorporeal. A high Dexterity is important, since incorporeal ghosts cannot wear armor unless it has the {i}ghost touch{/i} ability.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Ghostwalk Campaign Source" compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

  <thing id="cEidolonce" name="Eidoloncer" description="The eidolon class was designed with the idea that ghost characters who want to advance their ghost powers can keep levels in eidolon, while ghost characters who want to advance their abilities in a normal class can gain levels in a normal class. The eidolon class allows most characters willing to dabble in ghost powers to do so, while still advancing their base attack bonus and providing a reasonable selection of skills. However, spellcasters are hurt the most by advancing as eidolons, and players of these characters may become frustrated by the stifled spell progression. For these characters, the optional eidoloncer class is a much better option.\n\nAn eidoloncer follows all the same rules as an eidolon: A ghost character must take levels in either eidolon or eidoloncer, a ghost who is raised from the dead has a life epiphany and may convert eidoloncer levels to levels in another class, and so on.\n\n{b}Adventures{/b}: Most eidoloncers enjoy being ghosts as another aspect of existence and pursue the same interests and studies they had when alive.

For example, you could make a suit of half-plate out of ectoplasm and it would function exactly like normal half-plate. It takes 1 full round per pound of weight of the object to craft it, so a suit of ectoplasmic half-plate takes 50 rounds (5 minutes) to shape. You must make an appropriate Craft check to shape articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, and so on).\n\nThe material is obviously formed of ectoplasm and lasts for a number of hours equal to your Wisdom bonus + 1. Tempered ectoplasm has all the properties of raw ectoplasm, except that it lasts longer and it maintains whatever form you mold it into.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Ghostwalk Campaign Setting" compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

You add your favored enemy bonus for that type of creature to saving throws against the standard extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of your favored enemy. You do not gain this bonus against other attacks by the creature. For example, a ranger with undead as a favored enemy would gain his favored enemy bonus on saves against a vampire&#146;s domination ability, but not to saves against the poison on its dagger or any saves against spells it cast from class levels. This saving throw bonus applies to all secondary effects of the favored enemy&#146;s attacks, so the ranger would also get his favored enemy bonus on the Fortitude save to remove a negative level caused by the vampire&#146;s energy drain ability.\n\n{b}Special{/b}: You may take this feat only as a 1st-level character.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Ghostwalk Campaign Setting" compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

Witchlight sheds light as a candle and may be pale red, orange, green, blue, or violet. Maintaining witchlight requires concentration, and you can maintain its effect on an object as long as it is within 100 feet of you.
