The more ancient beholders are powerful arcanists (see Elder Orbs, above) that have used magic to extend their lifespans. Nevertheless, two practical limitations keep beholders from becoming spellcasters. First, their lack of hands makes it hard for them to use large numbers of spell components. Second, their central eye&#146;s antimagic cone makes the study and use of arcane magic difficult.\n\nHowever, an increasing number of beholders are embracing a practice once held to be vile and unthinkable to their kind. Through ritual destruction of its central eye, a beholder can learn to channel and use magic much more quickly and efficiently than can almost any other race. These are the members of the beholder mage prestige class, and the power they wield is truly impressive." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">

  <thing id="cBeMSpells" name="Beholder Mage Spellcasting" description="A beholder mage gains the ability to cast arcane spells. These spells are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. At 1st level, a beholder mage masters all the cantrips detailed in the Player&#146;s Handbook and also knows two 1st-level spells. Each time it gains a level, it automatically learns two more spells of any level it can cast.\n\nTo learn or cast a spell, a beholder mage must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a beholder mage&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell level + the beholder mage&#146;s Intelligence modifier. A beholder mage&#146;s spells function at a caster level equal to twice its beholder mage level.\n\nA beholder mage can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Its base daily spell allotment is given in Table 3&#150;1. In addition, it receives bonus spells per day if it has a high Intelligence score.\n\nA beholder mage combines the best of two worlds; it can learn new spells as a wizard can, and there is no upper limit to the number of spells it can learn and know. However, it casts its spells on the fl y like a sorcerer. A beholder mage of high level typically knows a huge number of spells and can call upon any one of them at any time, providing it has a spell slot open of the appropriate spell level.\n\nStarting at 1st level, whenever a beholder mage gains the ability to cast a new level of spells, it must sacrifice the use of its eye rays from one of its ten small eyestalks. From then on, that eyestalk casts spells of that level and is referred to as a spell-stalk. At 10th level, all of its eyestalks are spell-stalks.\n\nAs with its eye rays, casting a spell from a spell-stalk is a free action (although a single spell-stalk can cast only one spell per round). The spell is technically considered a cast spell (as opposed to the use of a spell-like ability), and thus the act of casting provokes attacks of opportunity normally. A spell cast from a spell-stalk otherwise resolves normally; unlike an eye ray, it does not need to make a ranged touch attack to successfully strike a target (unless the spell itself requires a touch attack). The standard beholder limitation against turning more than three eyestalks in any particular direction (that is, forward, backward, left, right, up, or down) still applies.\n\nBeholder mages do not require material components to cast their spells. The ruined central eye acts as an arcane focus for all the creature&#146;s spells. If a spell normally requires a material component that carries with it a gold-piece cost, the beholder mage instead spends a number of experience points equal to one-fifth of the normal gold-piece cost (minimum of 1 experience point). The somatic components of a beholder mage&#146;s spells are supplied by the weaving and waving of its spell-stalks. The verbal component of a beholder mage&#146;s spells is the creature&#146;s special spellcasting song. The song takes effort; a beholder mage that is casting spells cannot speak or use its mouth to do anything else that round, including making bite attacks." compset="ClSpecial" summary="No comp/focus needed, use XP if cost, free act to cast 3 eyes per arc.">

You can choose different targets for the two ocular spells.\n\nWhen you release an ocular spell, its effect changes to a ray with a range of up to 60 feet. If the spell previously would have affected multiple creatures, it now affects only the creature struck by the ray. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target with an ocular spell, and the target is still permitted any saving throw allowed by the spell.\n\n{i}Example{/i}: Ferno, an 11th-level wizard with the Ocular Spell feat, could prepare two {i}scorching ray{/i} spells as ocular spells, casting them at the beginning of the day. In combat, he can take a full-round action to fire off both {i}scorching ray{/i} spells. He can fire each spell at a different target, and he gets all three rays from each spell.\n\nAn ocular spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell&#146;s actual level." compset="Metamagic" summary="Store up to two spells in eyes, release both as full rd. +2 Level." uniqueness="unique">
