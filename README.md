Community Maintained D&D 3.5 Data for Hero Labs
===============================================

Please note that this is an unofficial fork at the moment. I am hoping we can get the official resources onto GitHub soon. Until then, this is largely a personal project.

Please visit the official information at [the official forum thread](http://forums.wolflair.com/showthread.php?t=11584).

Requirements
------------

This project requires a legitimate copy of [Hero Lab](http://www.wolflair.com/index.php?context=hero_lab), with a license for d20.

Installation
------------

To get started with the community resources, you need to add a custom data source. Do so by doing the following:
# Start Hero Lab, and click the <b>Find Updates</b> button.
# In the options pane, click <b>Add Source</b>, then <b>New Source</b>.
# Enter <b><code>http://null.rp-addict.com/herolab/updates.xml</code></b>
# Restart Hero Lab, and go back to <b>Find Updates</b>.
# Double click <b>Community d20 Data Set</b>, and follow the on-screen instructions.
# Restart Hero Lab one more time, and enjoy.
