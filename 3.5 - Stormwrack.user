  <thing id="cScCorsair" name="Scarlet Corsair" description="{b}Special{/b}: Must have established a reputation as a fearsome pirate.\n\n&#147;{i}The seas run red this night, and terror has a face. You are looking upon that face. Pretty, isn&#146;t it?{/i}&#148;\n&#151;Adia Ironheart of the Red Wake, a scarlet corsair\n\nMany pirates sail the seas, but few reach the infamy of the scarlet corsair, so called from the trail of blood left in her wake. Where most other pirates are content to use intimidation to cow their opponents into submission, allowing them to plunder as they please, the scarlet corsair revels in combat and slaughter.\n\nThis isn&#146;t to say that all scarlet corsairs are violent killers, though most certainly are&#151;a few scarlet corsairs refuse to take on a target unless that target is capable of putting up a good fight. Whether patriotic privateer or self-serving buccaneer, the scarlet corsair relies on the reputation of her quick blade and terrible fighting skills to drive her prey before her.\n\nBECOMING A SCARLET CORSAIR\nA life of piracy is the first and foremost necessity in becoming a scarlet corsair. Because this isn&#146;t an organization but rather a folk status gained through the pirate&#146;s victims retelling the stories of her attacks upon their vessels, word of mouth is essential. Most pirates seek some level of infamy: Those who acquire it for a combination of ferocious fighting and the ability to instill fear in all who face them are well on their way to becoming scarlet corsairs.\n\nFighters and rogues make good scarlet corsairs, since the combination of those classes provides both the flair and fighting prowess necessary to boost a simple pirate to the status of the scarlet corsair. Rangers too have adopted this prestige class, using intimidation and skilled swordsmanship to defeat their enemies. And a few assassins have taken to the seas in pursuit of their vocation of killing people for profit and have become scarlet corsairs." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">
