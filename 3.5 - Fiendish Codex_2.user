This brand might be a physical symbol, or it could be a strange change in your body&#146;s structure.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Lawful evil, devil.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you select this feat, choose an archdevil to whom you have sworn fealty. You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks made against denizens of that archdevil&#146;s layer, but take a &#150;2 penalty on the same checks made against denizens of other layers. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. The brand grants an additional benefit, depending upon the archdevil with which it is associated.\n\n{i}Bel{/i}: The brand of Bel is a cold iron longsword or greatsword (your choice) that glistens with green hellfire. This weapon deals normal damage appropriate to your size, plus an extra 1d6 points of damage against good-aligned creatures, or an extra 2d6 points of damage against demons. You are proficient with this weapon, even if you normally lack weapon proficiency with the longsword or greatsword.\n\n{i}Dispater{/i}: In keeping with your lord&#146;s fearful paranoia, you grow a pair of eyes in the back of your head. You cannot be flanked, nor can you be caught flat-footed.\n\n{i}Mammon{/i}: The brand of Mammon allows you to better play the careful game of balance necessary of all devils. When faced with mighty foes, you grovel and ask for mercy. Against weaker enemies, you show no quarter. If you attack an opponent with more HD than you, you automatically begin to project an aura of pity in a 30-foot radius around you. All creatures in this area must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier) or take a &#150;2 penalty on attacks against you. They see you as weak, pathetic, and barely worth the effort of slaying. \n\nCreatures with fewer HD than you, or any creature at half its maximum hit points or less (even one with more HD than you), suffer a different effect from this aura. These creatures become shaken (Will negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier) as you take on a ghastly, enraged aspect in their eyes. A creature with more HD than you that is subsequently reduced to half hit points must make a new save against this version of your aura. If it fails, the creature becomes shaken but it no longer takes the &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls described above (if it failed its save against the first aura effect). \nThis aura is a mind-affecting ability. A creature needs to save against each version of the aura only once every 24 hours. The aura&#146;s effect last as long as a creature is within its area.\n\n{i}Fierna and Belial{/i}: The brand of Fierna and Belial consumes you, infesting your thoughts with sinister urges. Once per round, you can use a melee touch attack to bestow these dark impulses on another creature. The target of this ability must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier). If it fails this save, the target is dazed for 1 round, lost in starry dreams of endless treasure, arcane might, and wishes fulfilled. You can use this mind-affecting ability once every 1d4 rounds.\n\n{i}Levistus{/i}: The brand of Levistus grants you a mystical link to that trapped archdevil&#146;s prison. Once per day as a swift action, you become encased in armor of ice. You gain resistance to cold 20, and all of your natural attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of cold damage. This benefi t lasts for 10 minutes.\n\n{i}Glasya{/i}: The brand of Glasya fills you with power, drawn from the shuddering remains of the Hag Countess. Once per day, you can activate this ability as a swift action. You gain fast healing 3 for 1 minute. Pulpy, tumorous flesh erupts from your wounds to seal your injuries.\n\n{i}Baalzebul{/i}: This brand causes your body to sweat a glistening slime. You gain a +4 bonus on grapple and Escape Artist checks. Your natural attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of acid damage.\n\n{i}Mephistopheles{/i}: The brand of Mephistopheles burns with unholy energy. Three times per day, as a swift action, you can invoke those flames to wreathe your body. For 1 round, all of your natural attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of fi re damage. If you are grappled or struck by an unarmed attack, your attacker takes 1d6 points of fire damage. At the start of each of your turns, any creatures in squares adjacent to you take 1d6 points of fire damage.\n\n{i}Asmodeus{/i}: The brand of Asmodeus fi lls you with power and authority. Three times per day as a swift action, you can use command, as the spell, as a spell-like ability.\n\n{b}Special{/b}: Once a character gains a brand of the Nine Hells, it can never gain the brand of another archdevil.\n\nNondevils can gain this feat, and the feats that require it as a prerequisite, by performing a particularly useful act for an archduke of Hell.
