  <thing id="fCityMagic" name="City Magic" description="You can use the city itself to shape and enhance your spellcasting.\n\n{b}Prerequisite{/b}: Caster level 3rd.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: You can modify any damaging spell you cast to incorporate the urban environment. When casting an offensive spell with an energy subtype&#151;acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic&#151;you can invest the spell with a portion of the city&#146;s spirit. In most cases, this investment is gritty and spectacular, drawing dirt, gravel, nails, and other nearby detritus into the spell effect. In other cases, the investiture is much more subtle, often merely changing the look of the spell. Only half the damage from a spell with the appropriate subtype is considered energy damage, and is thus subject to resistances or immunities. The remainder comes from the city itself, and is not subject to spell or energy resistances or immunities. This investiture only occurs for spells cast within urban environments, defined as any area above the size of a small town (DMG 137).\n\nFor example, a wizard uses City Magic to cast a {i}fireball{/i} at a creature with resistance to fire 15. The damage roll is 20, half of it fire damage and half &#147;city.&#148; Thus, the target takes 10 points of &#147;city&#148; damage instead of 5 points of fire damage. This feat is useless to spellcasters who cast their spells in a nonurban environment as defined above.\n\nA spell modified using the City Magic feat uses a spell slot of the spell&#146;s normal level.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Cityscape" compset="Feat" summary="Half of the energy dam of spell cast in city ignores resist/immune. +0 Level." uniqueness="useronce">

For instance, a {i}magic missile{/i} might shoot from a nearby doorway, rather than from your own finger, or a {i}lightning bolt{/i} might emerge from the floor rather than from you. You cannot use this feat to gain a bonus to hit, to circumvent cover, to flank, or in any other way to gain a numeric or mechanical advantage on any attack rolls. Its purpose is to disguise the source of the spell, preventing anyone who did not actively observe you casting it from recognizing you as its caster.

For example, a suit of studded leather would have a +4 armor bonus rather than 3. However, because you must adjust and customize the armor to more effectively cover weak spots, it is also slightly more encumbering, increasing its armor check penalty by 1. You are not required to make use of this feat.

All other aspects of the spell, including range, area, targets, and damage remain the same. Note that this feat has no bearing on any components required to cast the enhanced spell, so the spell&#146;s source might still be apparent, depending on the situation, despite its effects being unseen.

Choose one skill associated with the organization to which your contact belongs. You gain 1 bonus rank in that skill (even if doing so would put you above your normal maximum ranks for that skill). In addition, you can double the frequency with which you can call upon your primary contact for no-charge favors. For example, if your primary contact normally provides its no-charge favor once per month, you can now call upon that favor twice per month.\n\n{b}Special{/b}: This feat cannot be taken more than once. If the primary contact associated with this feat dies or is otherwise removed from the campaign, the DM can, at his discretion, either replace that contact with a new contact from the same organization or allow you to name one of your other contacts as your primary contact.

You cannot benefit from more than one maneuver in the same round.\n\n{i}Death from Above{/i}: You do substantial damage if you deliberately leap down to attack a foe beneath you. You must drop at least 20 feet. You must roll to hit; this qualifies as a charge attack, with all relevant bonuses and penalties. If you hit, you deal damage as normal, plus an extra 1d6 points for every 10 feet of distance beyond the first 10 feet; thus, a drop of 30 feet causes an extra 2d6 points of damage.\n\nYou still take whatever damage you would normally take from the fall, but you can reduce the falling damage with a successful Jump check or Tumble check. You cannot use any ability to slow your fall (such as the monk&#146;s slow fall ability, or the {i}feather fall{/i} spell) while attacking in this manner.\n\n{i}Urban Acrobatics{/i}: You can make use of windowsills, awnings, lampposts, and similar features of the city when leaping or falling from buildings. If you deliberately jump downward within arm&#146;s reach of a wall or similar vertical surface, you can move yourself sideways along the wall, traveling up to 5 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall. If you accidentally fall, you can move 5 feet horizontally for every 20 feet you fall. You can move up to your full movement horizontally in this fashion (so long as the wall is wide enough), even if that distance, plus your falling distance, exceeds your normal movement rate.\n\n{b}Normal{/b}: Falling characters can move in no direction but down.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Cityscape" compset="Feat" summary="Gain various tactical options when jumping down from high places." uniqueness="useronce">

You must make another Gather Information check every hour you search, as well as each time the trail becomes more difficult to follow, such as when it takes you to a different part of town. The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depends on on the community size and the prevailing conditions. If you fail a check, you can retry after 1 hour of questioning; the DM should roll the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn&#146;t know exactly how much time the task will require. You can cut the time between Gather Information checks in half (from 1 hour to 30 minutes), but you take a &#150;5 penalty on the check.
