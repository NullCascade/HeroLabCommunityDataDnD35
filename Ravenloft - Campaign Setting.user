  <thing id="rRvnHlfVis" name="Half-Vistani" description="Half-Vistani (or {i}giogoto{/i}, in the Vistani patterna [see below]) are the result of a union between a Vistana and a {i}giorgio{/i} (any non-Vistani human). Unlike the other special races of Ravenloft, half-Vistani are entirely human. However, the traits they inherit from their Vistani blood separate them from normal men.\n\nLove affairs between {i}giorgio{/i} and the Vistani are often torrid and brief. The cultural rift cuts deeply, so precious few {i}giogoto{/i} ever grow up knowing both of their parents. Most often, the Vistana parent moves on in the night, abandoning the child to the {i}giorgio{/i}. Rarely, a {i}giogoto{/i} child is raised by the tribe of its Vistana parent. In either case, the child may be cared for but is never truly accepted. The {i}giogoto&apos;s giorgio{/i} family may fear that the child will develop the peculiar talents of her Vistani kin, and since the {i}giogoto{/i} is not fully &quot;of the blood,&quot; she finds herself unable to share entire worlds of Vistani experiences.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Broken homes are the {i}giogoto&apos;s{/i} birthright. Many spend their lives haunted by their youth; a rejected child often matures into a sullen and withdrawn adult.\n\nIt is no small matter to straddle the cultural rift of their birth, so most {i}giogoto{/i} choose to adopt one culture over the other. They either adhere to the customs of their homeland or wrap themselves in the Vistani mystique. Regardless of the heritage they favor, half-Vistani tend to be passionate and pessimistic individuals.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: Half-Vistani resemble their Vistani parents, often inheriting their angular and aquiline features, eyes and hair of deep brown or black, and dusky or olive complexions. Of course, {i}giogoto{/i} often exhibit traits of their {i}giorgio{/i} heritage as well. A {i}giogoto{/i} can conceal her Vistani heritage, fooling {i}giorgio{/i} with a successful Disguise check (considered minor details only). Such tricks fail against true Vistani, however, who can identify those who are &quot;of the blood&quot; with but a glance.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: {i}Giogoto{/i} are caught between two worlds; {i}giorgio{/i} treat them like Vistani, and the Vistani treat them like {i}giorgio{/i}. A {i}giogoto&apos;s{/i} outlook toward nonhumans usually mirrors that of his homeland. It is not uncommon, however, for half-Vistani to be more accepting toward other &quot;unwelcome&quot; creatures, such as Calibans and half-elves.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: In many ways, the {i}giorgio{/i} life mimics that of half-elves. Many half-Vistani spend their lives alienated from society and often grow to distrust authority. {i}Giogoto{/i} ethical alignment tends toward chaos, but they are no more inherently good or evil than any other humans.\n\n{b}Homelands{/b}: The Vistani endlessly wander throughout the Land of Mists, so a {i}giogoto{/i} may be born in any domain. The ruthless oppression of Vistani in Invidia makes native half-Vistani rare in that domain, while {i}giogoto{/i} are slightly more common in neighboring Barovia. No permanent half-Vistani communities exist anywhere in Ravenloft.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: {i}Giogoto{/i} raised by {i}giorgio{/i} typically adopt the prevalent faith of their homeland. {i}Giogoto{/i} raised by the Vistani are seldom religious; the Vistani worship no gods and have many legends of their cruel mistreatment at the hands of godlike beings in the distant past. Some Vistani, particularly those of the Vatraska tribe, treat fate, the Mists, and the forces of nature with a respect that approaches reverence, however.\n\n{b}Language{/b}: {i}Giogoto{/i} have no language of their own, instead learning the domain languages of their homeland. {i}Giogoto{/i} who embrace their Vistani heritage often also learn {i}pattema{/i}, the Vistani&apos;s spoken language, and {i}tralaks{/i}, the Vistani system of trail symbols.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: {i}Giogoto{/i} raised by giorgio are often given names drawn from their homeland&apos;s cultures. {i}Giogoto{/i} raised by the Vistani are named in the Vistani tradition, and it is not unheard of for a half-Vistani raised by a {i}giorgio{/i} to be named after her wayward Vistana parent.\n\n{b}Vistani Male Names{/b}: Bela, Grigori, losif, Karol, Ludovic, Nicu, Pyotr, Simione, Stefan, Vasile.\n\n{b}Vistani Female Names{/b}: Ana, Eliza, Isabela, Lela, Natasha, Papusza, Rozalina, Sofya, Ursula, Yvonne.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Many {i}giogoto{/i} become wanderers, seeking happiness in foreign lands. Many fall in with other outcasts and eccentrics during their aimless travels.\n\n{b}Recommended Feats{/b}: Alertness, Ethereal Empathy, Lunatic, Track, Voice of Wrath.\n\n{b}Source{/b}: Ravenloft Campaign Setting" compset="Race">

Those who can see ethereal creatures may spot the geist lurking near you, but it is otherwise invisible and intangible. The geist acts as a second pair of eyes and ears when it manifests, allowing you a second roll on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.

You can ask the geist to manifest whenever you are alone. The geist immediately vanishes if another intelligent, living creature enters the scene. You can summon the geist as often as you want, but each time it manifests, it inflicts 1 point of temporary Charisma damage as it unconsciously draws strength from your will to live." compset="Feat" summary="The spirit of a friend, ally, or loved one has returned from the grave to watch over you as a geist." uniqueness="useronce">

W. Hoffman, &quot;The Sand-Man&quot;{/i}\n\nPride is perhaps the most deadly of sins, and it is of pride that the artificial monstrosities known as constructs are born. When mortal man takes it upon himself to create life, he tampers with forces that would best be left undisturbed. Unfortunately, some refuse to recognize the wisdom of remaining within the natural order, and the result is a twisted mockery of life.\n\nIn most lands, the animation of a construct requires the use of great magics and expensive materials. Ravenloft does not hold such restrictions. Anyone with the mad desire to bring life to the inanimate can potentially do so, and the results are always tragic.\n\n{b}The Creation{/b}\nA construct created not through magic but through the dark desires of its creator is known as a golem of obsession, or a dread golem. Dread golems are created when an individual is obsessed with giving life to the inanimate. The possible reasons for such an obsession are numerous. The creator may see the creation of life as a noble scientific experiment, an artistic project, or the opportunity to restore life to a lost loved one. The reasons are ultimately immaterial; what matters is the obsession itself. That obsession is the seed that ultimately gives the dread golem &quot;life.&quot; The assembly of the golem&apos;s body, whether it be the sculpting of a statue or the sewing together of corpses, serves to imprint the construct with the creator&apos;s desires. The mechanism of animation, whether it be a fervent prayer or a channeled bolt of lightning, serves to focus the creator&apos;s anticipation to a crescendo. It is the emotion ofthis moment, when the creator is watching to discover whether his life&apos;s ambition has resulted in feverishly desired success or desperately feared failure, that truly serves to animate the construct. From the dark desires of his creator, the dread golem is born.\n\n{b}The Dread Golem{/b}\n&quot;Dread Golem&quot; is a template that can be added to any construct, hereafter referred to as the &quot;base construct.&quot; The template must be added at the moment of creation, under the circumstances described above. An existing construct cannot later become a dread golem, at least as far as is known." compset="Template" uniqueness="unique">

The creature merely has to move over the opponents in its path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling creature&#146;s space is subject to the trample attack. If a target&#146;s space is larger than 5 feet, it is only considered trampled if the trampling creature moves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves over only some of a target&#146;s space, the target can make an attack of opportunity against the trampling creature at a -4 penalty. A trampling creature that accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space returns to the last legal position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if there&#146;s a legal position that&#146;s closer.\n\nA trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the creature&#146;s slam damage + 1&#189; times its Str modifier). The creature&#146;s descriptive text gives the exact amount.\n\nTrampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a -4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage.\n\nThe save DC against a creature&#146;s trample attack is 10 + &#189; creature&#146;s HD + creature&#146;s Str modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature&#146;s descriptive text). A trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.{/i}" compset="Special" summary="The golem gains the trample ability.">
