  <thing id="ioBrMagRes" name="Bracelet of Magic Resistance" description="This magical bracelet, designed by Black Robe wizards, appears to be made of silver, about four inches in width, set with pieces of polished onyx. When worn, it protects its wearer against all forms of magical fear, including dragonfear and the supernatural fear of the Shoikan Grove. Its greatest benefit comes in its ability to completely block magic from affecting the wearer.\n\nWhen originally created, the bracelet has 25 charges. A spell cast upon the wearer is absorbed by the bracelet, draining 1 charge per level of the spell. When the last charge is drained, the stones on the bracelet crumble to dust. Any spell drained by the bracelet is ruined, even if there are not enough charges to absorb the final spell. For example, the bracelet has only 1 charge remaining when a sorcerer casts a {i}fireball{/i} spell upon the wearer. Although {i}fireball{/i} is a 3rd-level spell, the remaining charge in the bracelet is expended and it is enough to absorb the {i}fireball{/i}. (Note: when determining what spells the bracelet can absorb, the bracelet can absorb any spell in which the wearer is the target or any spell that normally allows for Spell Resistance.)\n\nThese bracelets are unholy items. They bestow one negative level on any lawful good creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as long as the bracelet is worn and disappears when the bracelet is no longer worn. This negative level does not result in actual level loss. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including {i}restoration spells) while the bracelet is worn.\n\nModerate necromancy and strong abjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, {i}heroism{/i}, {i}spell turning{/i}, creator must be evil; Price 73,125 stl; Weight 0.5 lb." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="sWizConsen" name="Consensus" description="This spell is typically cast only by the highest ranking Wizards of High Sorcery, those who serve as Master of the Conclave or as the Masters of the Orders. Historically, the spell has been used most frequently to elect a new Master of the Conclave, the one wizard to whom (theoretically, at least) all other members of the Orders of High Sorcery answer.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose whether to send a message to all members of one particular Order (the White Robes, Red Robes, or Black Robes), or to the members of all three Orders. This message cannot be more than 10 seconds long. It is telepathically carried to all non-renegade spellcasters who have passed the Test of High Sorcery. The message travels any distance, although it cannot reach those not on the Material Plane (including those in extra-dimensional spaces or in alternate realms of existence). The message can penetrate any magical barriers or mental protections (including such protections as {i}mind blank{/i}), but cannot be received by wizards rendered unconscious by way of injury. Wizards who are sleeping at the time of casting are awakened as the message is received.\n\nAs a free action, anyone who has received the message can telepathically return a one word reply (typically, &#147;yea,&#148; &#147;nay,&#148; or &#147;abstain.&#148;) The decision to return the message is voluntary, so a wizard may choose not to respond.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, your mind is not bombarded with every individual&#146;s response; instead they are filtered into a single answer, depending upon the majority vote." compset="Spell">

  <thing id="sWizTReave" name="Timereaver" description="Another spell known only to the Masters of the respective Towers of High Sorcery, {i}timereaver{/i} is one of the most potentially powerful and dangerous spells known on Ansalon. This spell creates a portal through time and space and allows up to 1 individual per 4 levels of the spellcaster to travel through the portal to another period of time.\n\nOriginally intended to allow wizards to research the past or the future, the spell allows individuals to travel backward or forward along the River of Time. The travelers can travel up to 20 years per level of the spellcaster backward in time, or 1 year per level of the spellcaster forward in time (as the future is much more difficult to navigate). The spell pierces the barriers between both time and space. It requires incredible concentration from the spellcaster in order to ensure that travelers end up at both the right time and in the right place (requiring a Spellcraft check at DC 10 + 1 for every decade traveled backward and a Spellcraft check at DC 15 + 1 for every year traveled forward). If the Spellcraft check is failed: 1) the travelers end up either in the right time but the wrong place &#151; 25 miles away per point the Spellcraft check is failed, in a random direction (50% chance), 2) in the right place but the wrong time &#151; up to 5 years per point the Spellcraft check is failed either before or after the targeted time (50% chance). Either failure may place the travelers in a precarious situation, particularly as the spell is a one-way trip (unless the travelers are provided with a means of returning, such as through the {i}device of time journeying{/i} or another such rare, powerful artifact).\n\nAt the beginning of time, the High God dictated that alterations to the River of Time were forbidden, thus those using the {i}timereaver{/i} spell cannot affect either the past or the future, no matter how hard they try (as a pebble dropped into a river cannot alter the river&#146;s path). However, if one of the Chaos Races (any race altered by the effects of the Graystone, such as kender, gully dwarves, dwarves, minotaurs, or sea elves) travels through time, the touch of Chaos within them allows for the possibility of time alteration &#151; a potentially disastrous consequence. This spell was primarily used by the Masters of the Towers to send individuals through time to research aspects of the past or the future, secure in the knowledge the travelers could do little to affect the River of Time. Such expeditions were rarely undertaken, however, as artifacts like the {i}device of time journeying{/i} (which originally allowed only a single individual to return through time) are exceedingly rare and difficult to produce.\n\n{i}Material Component{/i}: A magical circle, created by a mixture of rare ingredients worth at least 10,000 stl + 1000 stl per decade traveled backward in time or per year traveled forward in time.\n\n{i}Arcane Focus{/i}: A major artifact, which is temporarily inert for 1 hour per decade of time traversed backwards or 1 year of time traveled forward.\n\n{i}XP Cost{/i}: 1,000 XP + 500 XP/decade traveled backward in time or year traveled forward in time.\n\nNote: Prior to the Chaos War, traveling forward in the future reveals a world the gods never left, for Takhisis had not stolen the world. Following the Chaos War, traveling backward in time is impossible past the beginning of the Fifth Age (the moment Chaos was defeated and Takhisis stole the world) up until the gods return after the War of Souls, at which point movement forward and backward in time is unhindered." compset="Spell">

Either failure may place the travelers in a precarious situation, particularly as the spell is a one-way trip (unless the travelers are provided with a means of returning, such as through the {i}device of time journeying{/i} or another such rare, powerful artifact).\n\nAt the beginning of time, the High God dictated that alterations to the River of Time were forbidden, thus those using the {i}timereaver{/i} spell cannot affect either the past or the future, no matter how hard they try (as a pebble dropped into a river cannot alter the river&#146;s path). However, if one of the Chaos Races (any race altered by the effects of the Graystone, such as kender, gully dwarves, dwarves, minotaurs, or sea elves) travels through time, the touch of Chaos within them allows for the possibility of time alteration &#151; a potentially disastrous consequence. This spell was primarily used by the Masters of the Towers to send individuals through time to research aspects of the past or the future, secure in the knowledge the travelers could do little to affect the River of Time. Such expeditions were rarely undertaken, however, as artifacts like the {i}device of time journeying{/i} (which originally allowed only a single individual to return through time) are exceedingly rare and difficult to produce.\n\n{i}Material Component{/i}: A magical circle, created by a mixture of rare ingredients worth at least 10,000 stl + 1000 stl per decade traveled backward in time or per year traveled forward in time.\n\n{i}Arcane Focus{/i}: A major artifact, which is temporarily inert for 1 hour per decade of time traversed backwards or 1 year of time traveled forward.\n\n{i}XP Cost{/i}: 1,000 XP + 500 XP/decade traveled backward in time or year traveled forward in time.\n\nNote: Prior to the Chaos War, traveling forward in the future reveals a world the gods never left, for Takhisis had not stolen the world. Following the Chaos War, traveling backward in time is impossible past the beginning of the Fifth Age (the moment Chaos was defeated and Takhisis stole the world) up until the gods return after the War of Souls, at which point movement forward and backward in time is unhindered." compset="Spell">

  <thing id="cWinternor" name="Winternorn" description="{b}Special{/b}: Must have been taught the traditions and rituals of the winternorns by one who already knows them.\n\nAmong the Ice Folk of the southern reaches of Ansalon, the art of arcane magic is practiced by a small number of ice wizards known as winternorns. The harsh environment breeds mages who are not only attuned to the icy climate, but who are permitted to see into the fog-shrouded distance of the River of Time, catching brief glimpses of every man&#146;s fate.\n\nMost NPC winternorns are neutrally aligned, as they dispassionately follow the dictates of fate and understand the fickle natural whims of the frozen wastelands of the south. Good winternorns act as protectors and wardens. Evil winternorns are cold hearted and bitter individuals, who act only in the pursuit of darkness. Winternorns are not exclusively found among the Ice Folk. From time to time, mages from other regions have journeyed south to gain the knowledge and lore of the ice wizards.\n\nSo long as the three moons shine above Krynn, winternorns will be almost entirely drawn from the ranks of the wizard class. During the early Age of Mortals, sorcerers with an affinity for cryomancy and divination will often bear the mantle of the winternorn. Their numbers will be fewer following the return of the gods. A party of adventurers traveling in Icereach may seek a winternorn&#146;s help against the White Dragon sisters, while heroes in Southern Ergoth may stumble upon an evil winternorn&#146;s plan to ally with Gellidus and spread her icy realm even further.\n\nThe dark elf renegade Feal-Thas is an example of a former Black Robe wizard who practiced the traditions of the winternorns." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">

This First Conclave trained other spellcasters, starting a process of seeking out worthy students and handing down the principles and codes that would eventually bring order to the arcane energies that threatened constantly to disrupt the world. Since that time, the laws of magic have been upheld by all three orders of the Wizards of High Sorcery.\n\nWhen a wizard successfully completes the Test of High Sorcery, those conducting the Test determine which color robes he will wear and which god of magic focuses his power. After the Test, the character is no longer simply a wizard and, so long as the other requirements are met, may begin taking levels in the Wizard of High Sorcery prestige class.\n\n{b}Wizards of the Black Robes{/b}: Though Black Robe wizards embrace the cause of evil, they don&#146;t seek to advance that cause by randomly hurling fireballs at the peasantry (at least not frequently), for such activities would abuse and jeopardize their primary loyalty to magic itself. Black Robe wizards may be cruel, but they are also selfish and cunning, and tend to avoid open acts of violence if more subtle ways can be found.\n\n{b}Wizards of the Red Robes{/b}: Red Robe wizards tread the path of neutrality, working to balance good and evil in addition to their ultimate loyalty to magic. While forces of good and evil may battle for control of Krynn, the forces of neutrality understand that it is the balanced dynamic of that battle that truly defines the world.\n\n{b}Wizards of the White Robes{/b}: Aside from their vow to uphold the primacy of magic, the cause of good is the White Robe wizards&#146; central concern. Acts that violate the precepts of good can lead to a wizard&#146;s ruin, and White Robes who stray from the path soon fi nd themselves cut off from Solinari&#146;s blessing. Though sometimes finding themselves allied with clerics of the pantheon of good or the Knights of Solamnia, the ever-present fear of persecution by a suspicious populace means that even White Robes must often operate alone." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">

When a moon is at Low Sanction (from waning crescent, through new, to waxing crescent), wizards of that moon&#146;s Order cast spells at &#150;1 caster level and with a &#150;1 to any spell save DCs. During the waxing and waning periods around the quarter moons, wizards of that moon&#146;s Order cast their spells normally.\n\nThe alignment of any two moons is a positive event for wizards of both orders, even if the moons are at Low Sanction. When two moons are in conjunction, wizards of both moons&#146; Orders cast spells at +1 caster level and with a +1 to any spell save DCs. These bonuses stack with any bonus or penalty already in place for the phase of the moons. Thus, if Lunitari and Nuitari come into conjunction at High Sanction, Wizards of the Red and Black Robes cast at caster level +2 and a +2 on spell save DCs. If the same two moons come into conjunction at Low Sanction, the benefit from the conjunction cancel out the penalty for the two moons being at Low Sanction, and these wizards cast spells as normal.\n\nWhen all three moons come into alignment, all magic becomes more powerful. Wizards of all three Orders cast spells at caster level +2 and with a +2 on spell save DCs. Again, these bonuses stack with any bonus or penalty in place for the phase of the moons. If the three moons are in conjunction at Low Sanction, every wizard still casts with +1 bonuses. If they align at High Sanction, the bonuses are +3. This alignment, known as the Night of the Eye, occurs in a cycle of 504 days (exactly 1&#150;1/2 years)." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Your magical strength is tied to the cycle of your patron&apos;s Moon." sortorder="1">

These libraries contain the spellbooks of countless wizards throughout history, stretching back to the Age of Dreams. With access to these libraries, it is easier for a wizard to create new spells or to add new spells to his spellbooks. When a wizard is researching or scribing a spell using the Tower&#146;s libraries, the time requirement for replacing or copying spells is halved (so a wizard can scribe two spells per day), while the cost for creating new spells is three-quarters of the normal cost (750 stl per week of research).\n\n{i}Access to Laboratories{/i}: Laboratories in the Tower of High Sorcery are available for the use of any Wizard of High Sorcery wanting to create magic items. The laboratories and come complete with most commonly used components. Rare and exotic components may have to be bartered for or gained independently through other channels. A wizard using these laboratories can almost certainly complete the creation process without interruption." compset="ClSpecial" summary="In Tower scribe spl 2x speed, -25% spl research cost, use item creation labs." sortorder="1">
