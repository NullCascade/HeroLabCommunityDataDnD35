Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3.0
Magic of Faerun 3.0
Players Guide to Faerun 3.5

Where information conflicts between 3.0 and 3.5.  Assume 3.5 to take precedence over older material.   In most places a note will be made of the source of the material is being used.

Several Classes from these books is not currently contained in this file, Including Incantrix and Red Wizard of Thay.  This may change at a later time, Incantrix was created by Sendric and Bodrin not myself.

Well mostly my work is done.

I still have some feats that will not work properly.

You must have the spell available to cast (prepared if you must prepare spells; known otherwise) and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce your XP total, you pay the cost upon beginning the attunement in addition to the XP cost for making the attuned gem itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when you begin casting, but focuses are not. (A focus used in attuning a gem can be reused.) The caster level of the spell must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own caster level. A gem can only be attuned with a single spell. The gem must have a minimum value equal to 50 gp per level of the spell to be stored. The base price of an attuned gem (not including the gem&apos;s inherent value) is equal to 50 gp per spell level times the caster level. You must spend 1/25 of the base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price. Attunement requires 1 hour plus the spell&apos;s normal casting time. The magic gem&apos;s market price equals its base price plus its inherent value as a gem. See the Gem Magic section in the previous chapter for the details of attuned gems and gem magic.\n\n{b}Source:{/b} {i}Magic of  Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.0 Edition" compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

While he fell in battle to a host of driders shortly after the weapon was created, it eventually reached the hands of another elven hero known only in ballads as the Stargazer, who used it to slay hundreds of drow over the course of her life. The Stargazer died of grief after the Battle of Nine Arrows when she realized her sister had been slain, and a young elven archer left with the weapon before drow reinforcements could arrive and seize it. The sword has appeared in the hands of an elf at least once every few hundred years since that battle, only to disappear again each time.\nThe sword bestows one negative level on any evil creature that holds it. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when it is no longer carried. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the sword is held. It is rumored that if the sword is ever drawn by a good-aligned drow, it would shatter into a thousand small (50 gp) moonstones.\nIf the rumor is true, each of these moonstones could be used once as an atonement spell to redeem a dark elf.\n\nCaster Level: 16th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, {i}holy smite{/i}, {i}summon monster I{/i}, creator must be a good elf; Market Price: 100,315 gp; Cost to Create: 51,315 gp +1,960 XP.\n\n{b}Source:{/b} {i}Magic to Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.0 Edition" compset="MagicWep" summary="+3 Holy Drow Bane (+5 and 2d6 vs Drow)">

The wizards of Halruaa guarded their secrets to creating these devices for centuries, leaving others to experiment (and fail) with various other methods.\nRecently a renegade Halruaan wizard revealed the process to another spellcaster, and a couple of wealthy governments have commissioned their own skyships.\nThe magic of a skyship comes in multiple parts.  First is the control rod, a bar of silver with a cylinder of gold slid over each end.  The rod is linked to the ten levitation plates (theoretically a larger ship would require more) affixed to the underside of the ship, which are traditionally made from the shells of Halruaan sea turtles.  The plates allow the ship to rise into the air and prevent it from entering water as a normal ship would, and the broad beam allows it to land on large flat surfaces without listing.  The magic that suspends the vessel grows weaker with altitude, greatly decreasing its cargo capacity, so a skyship normally stays within 100 feet of the ground (at which point its cargo capacity is 15 tons, much less than a conventional sailing ship).  The ship&#146;s horizontal movement is at the mercy of the wind, although its sails and supplemental magic from the plates allow it to turn with clumsy maneuverability.\nThe vertical movement of the ship is controlled by the rod and allows it to rise or fall at a speed of 45 feet.  A skyship is in all other respects like a standard sailing ship with respect to crew and dimensions.\n\nCaster Level: 15th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, {i}fly{/i}, {i}levitate{/i}; Market Price: 700,000 gp; Cost to Create: 355,000 gp + 27,600 XP.

It takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it. Made of blackened silver and steel, a newly created helm of darkness is set with thirty-six black opals along its lower edge and a great black sapphire in the front. The helm is self-identifying, though it does not reveal that it is a shadow item. It has the following powers.\n\n&#149;   With a command word, the wearer can bring forth a {i}deeper darkness{/i} effect. (The helm imparts the command word to the wearer.) The power issues from the sapphire, which can generate ninety-nine such effects before crumpling to useless dust.\n&#149;   Whenever the wearer fails a saving throw against any death effect, one black opal crumbles and the effect is negated. In addition, the helm negates energy drain attacks.\nEach time the wearer would receive one or more negative levels, a black opal crumbles to dust, negating the negative level. (An attack that bestows two negative levels consumes two opals.)\n&#149;   Each round, the helm absorbs the first 30 points of cold damage the wearer would otherwise take. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources, such as {i}endure elements{/i}.\n\nAs long as the helm contains at least one intact gem, the wearer is immune to fear effects and can see through any form of darkness as though it were daylight.

A glowstone looks like a many-faceted oval of glass or amber about the size of a human hand. The synthetic crystal is exceedingly hard and tough. A glowstone has a hardness of 60 and 60 hit points.\nA glowstone constantly emits light equal to a daylight spell. This light negates and dispels any darkness effect cast at 9th level or lower. Placing the glowstone in an opaque container blocks the light.\nA glowstone can power any item that requires charges.\nThe glowstone need only be placed on the charged item.\nThe glowstone sticks to the item like a magnet sticking to metal. It will not fall off by accident, but can be removed.\nFor every 10 minutes the glowstone remains attached to the item, the item regains 1 charge, up to its maximum number of charges. Each charge restored to an item drains 1 charge from the glowstone. Items subject to overcharging, such as a staff of the magi, will overcharge if left in contact with a glowstone too long.\nMagic items that are not charged, but allow only a limited number of uses per day, also can draw power from a glowstone. If the item is in contact with the glowstone for 10 minutes, the item&#146;s ability can be used one more time before becoming exhausted. Each extra use the item gains draws 7 charges from the glowstone.\nDwarves or gnomes who can cast divine spells can release a beam of power from a glowstone on command.\nThis beam is a ray up to 90 feet long. It deals 6d6 points of damage against any creature. The ray deals full damage to objects. Each beam released drains one charge from the glowstone.\nOne glowstone can recharge another. A living being must hold a stone in each hand and will one stone to recharge the other. One charge is drawn from the donor stone and transferred to the recipient stone each round.\nThe being conducting the transfer feels the energy flowing.\nAfter 1 minute, the flow of energy purifies the creature&#146;s body and neutralizes any poison, disease, infection, or embedded piece of foreign matter from the creature, including magical diseases such as mummy rot and lycanthropy.\nIf a glowstone is destroyed by an attack, it releases all its energy in a 70-foot spread. The blast deals 10d10 points of damage as long as the glowstone has at least 1 charge remaining.\nCreatures within 25 feet of the glowstone get no saving throws. Creatures more than 25 feet away can attempt Reflex saves (DC 23) for half damage.\nEvery glowstone had 1,000 charges when made, but they typically have d%&#215;10 charges remaining when found.

Except for the type of creature summoned, this works like a {i}summon nature&#146;s ally VII{/i} spell and costs no charges.\n\nAlso once a day, the wielder can dominate up to 36 Hit Dice worth of animals in a 1,500-foot-radius spread centered on the wielder. This effect affects each animal, from the closest to the farthest, until the next animal would take it over the 36 HD limit. Each animal is affected as if by a {i}dominate animal{/i} spell (DC 14).

If the spell resistance is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder exactly like a rod of absorption (see Chapter 8: Magic Items in the {i}DUNGEON MASTER&#146;s Guide{/i}). The staff uses spell levels as charges, not as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs spell levels beyond its 50-charge limit, it blackens into a charred cinder and is destroyed. The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at him, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a {i}rod of absorption{/i} does.   Absorbing spells is risky, but absorption is the only way to recharge the staff.\n\nCaster Level: 20th; Weight: 5 lb.\n\n{b}Source:{/b} {i}Magic of Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.0 Edition" compset="MagicWep" summary="+2 Great Druid Staff">

  <thing id="iMoonblade" name="Moonblade" description="These swords, sometimes called elf blades, are heirlooms of noble elven families. Only a few are known to exist, and these are jealously guarded. Still, rumors of dormant moonblades persist.\nA moonblade is an intelligent sword (usually a longsword) with an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5. A moonblade always has a good alignment (usually neutral good).\nA moonblade also has a special purpose to serve the scion of a particular elven family (see below for details). A line of runes decorates the blade, one rune for each wielder the blade has had. For each such rune, the moonblade has one ability from the list below.\nMoonblades are handed down from parent to child within the elven family the blade serves. The sword itself always determines which heir it belongs to. When a moonblade&#146;s owner dies, one of the owner&#146;s heirs can lay claim to the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant and exhibits no magical powers at all. A moonblade only serves one owner at a time.\nTo claim or awaken a moonblade, an elf or half-elf of the blade&#146;s alignment&#151;and from the correct family&#151; must hold the sword and perform the proper ritual. If the family the blade serves has died out, any elf or halfelf of the proper alignment can attempt to awaken the blade. The claiming/awakening ritual varies from blade to blade, but usually requires the blade to be unsheathed \nat the proper time and place (for example, in a royal throne room or place sacred to an elven deity). Upon completing the ritual, the sword either accepts or rejects the holder.\nWhether the sword accepts the holder is strictly up to the DM. In general, only brave and upstanding holders are accepted. Holders who have committed cowardly or selfish acts are rejected unless the holder has atoned for them in some way (such as receiving an atonement spell or performing some heroic or selfless act that wipes away the taint of the character&#146;s previous actions). Should the blade reject the holder, the holder receives 1d6 negative levels.\nThese never result in actual level loss, but if the number of negative levels exceed the holder&#146;s level, the holder dies.\nIf the holder survives, negative levels from the sword cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the character holds the sword.\nIf the sword accepts the new holder, the holder loses 5,000 XP and the sword attunes itself to the new holder.\n(If the holder lacks sufficient experience points to pay this cost, she cannot claim or awaken the blade.) A new rune appears on the blade, and the sword gains a new ability. (A moonblade never accepts a new owner if characters attempt to pass it among themselves just to make it manifest new powers.)\nA list of special abilities appropriate for moonblades appears below. The DM can pick one or generate it randomly.\nThe elfshadow weapon special ability is known to exist only in moonblades. An elfshadow is an incorporeal creature, contained in a gem set in a moonblade, that resembles an elf. It has all the characteristics of an undead shadow, except that it has a neutral alignment and cannot be turned, rebuked, or controlled by clerics (nor can anyone except the moonblade&#146;s wielder control it in any way).\n\nWhen called forth, the elfshadow can appear anywhere within 250 feet of the moonblade wielder. Once called, the elfshadow can go anywhere on the same plane as the moonblade wielder. The wielder has complete control over the elfshadow, and controlling the creature is a free action for the wielder. The elfshadow always acts on the moonblade wielder&#146;s turn.\n\nCaster Level: 15th.

This is a necromantic death effect.\n\nThe crown also has the following drawbacks.\n\n&#149; The wearer changes alignment to neutral evil while the crown is worn.\n&#149; The crown cannot be removed unless Myrkul wills it.\nNormally the only way the crown is removed is when it teleports itself away.\n&#149; The crown can use suggestion once per day on the wearer, and can possess the wearer for up to 20 minutes per day as if using a magic jar spell.\n&#149; The wearer slowly turns into an undead being over the course of two years. Use of the {i}cone of undeath{/i} or the {i}Myrkul&#146;s hand{/i} abilities advances this process 1d4 months per use. When the transformation is complete, the wearer appears lichlike and his type changes to &#147;undead,&#148; but he otherwise retains all his normal abilities.\nIf the wearer reaches this state and the crown teleports away, the wearer is instantly destroyed.\n&#149; The wearer is paranoid and possessive about the crown, keeping all others away from it.\n&#149; All beings within 100 feet of the crown while it is worn must make a Will save or be affected by a {i}sympathy spell{/i}.\n\nCaster Level: 20th; Weight: 2 lb.\n\n{b}Source:{/b} {i}Magic to Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.0 Edition" compset="Wondrous">

This power does not stack with a ring of wizardry or other effect that grants extra arcane spells.\nOnce per day, the wearer can dominate all reptilian creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or lower within a 1,500-foot radius. The effect lasts 1 hour and is similar to the dominate monster spell, except that it works on all reptilian creatures within the radius. The wearer can issue telepathic commands to all controlled reptilian creatures within 1,500 feet or to any single reptilian \ncreature or group of reptilian creatures that are in range and line of sight.\nNo reptilian creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower attacks the wearer, even if the wearer attacks the reptilian creature or the creature is under another naga crown wearer&#146;s control.

Spell failure chances for armor and shields made from gold are increased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is decreased by 2 (which may bring it below 0), and armor check penalties are increased by 3.\nGold weapons are considered heavy weapons (see the sidebar on {i}Heavy Weapons{/i}).\nMagically treated gold weighs twice as much as steel, has hardness 10, and has 30 hit points per inch of thickness.\n\n{b}Item                                                      Market Price Modifier{/b}\nArmor                                                 +5,000 gp\nWeapon damage up to 1d3          +1,500 gp\nWeapon damage 1d4 or 1d6        +2,500 gp\nWeapon damage 1d8 or higher   +7,000 gp\n\n{b}Weapon Benefit:{/b} Adds extra damage based on size.\n{b}Armor Benefit:{/b} Adds +2 Fire &amp; Acid Resist\n\n{b}Source:{/b} {i}Magic of Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.0 Edition" compset="Material" summary="+2 Fire &amp; Acid Resist to Armor, Extra damage based on wep damage.">

Any weirwood (or item created of weirwood) within an area illuminated by a magical light source (such as dancing lights, light, or continual flame) emits a gentle magical glow equivalent to a candle for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the area of illumination.\nLiving weirwood has fire resistance 20, though no one has ever discovered a method of preserving this quality after the wood is harvested.\n\n{b}Source:{/b} {i}Magic to Faer&#251;n{/i}, 3.0 Edition" compset="Gear">

  <thing id="cMysticWan" name="Mystic Wanderer" description="Mystic wanderers are divine spellcasters who eschew normal church hierarchies and instead embrace freedom, wanderlust, and independence. They believe that to serve their deities they need to experience the world, learn about its hidden beauties and truths, and learn how their own inner selves relate to the outer world. Mystic wanderers are known for their skill in creating potions and magic gems. \n\nMost mystic wanderers begin as clerics, although some druids and rangers pursue the life of a mystic wanderer as well. Because of the mystic wanderer&#146;s independence and disdain for authority figures, monks and paladins only become mystic wanderers if they have lapsed from their vows. Most mystic wanderers follow deities of beauty, individualism, love, hedonism, charisma, self-perfection, darkness, the moon, joy, fertility, motherhood, dance, music, disease, poison, luck, misfortune, or the seasons. \n\nMystic wanderer NPCs usually act alone, preferring to interact with people (including other mystic wanderers) on a person-to-person basis rather than in groups. They sometimes acquire bodyguards or friends who can act as bodyguards to balance their weaknesses in combat." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">
