  <thing id="cMasAmbass" name="Master Ambassador" description="{b}Special{/b}: Must have held a diplomatic office or position in which some courtly or political matter was resolved through the efforts of the character.\n\nThe master ambassador represents the individual who has the ability to conduct sensitive diplomatic missions, handle difficult negotiations, and formulate effective government policy&#150;all skills that are highly valued in a war-torn world. Such a person might be the representative of princes in foreign lands and often hostile courts. He may be acting in the interests of his liege or for his own ends, if the ambition of the master ambassador eclipses his loyalties. Whatever his cause, his skill in diplomacy remains keen.\n\nAll master ambassadors are experienced in political intrigue, in drafting agreements and treaties, and in understanding a foreign mindset. The master ambassador has the ability to lead a kingdom to riches or into ruin with the turn of a phrase.\n\nNobles, rogues and bards make the best master ambassadors because they have substantial skill backgrounds and their abilities complement the diplomatic nature of this class. Clerics, mystics, wizards and sorcerers are also good candidates, though their allegiances may often be divided if they are also bound to an arcane or religious agenda. Wilderness-oriented classes such as barbarians or rangers are rarely suited for the role of a master ambassador, usually due to social requirements.\n\nMaster ambassadors are ideal adventurers because they are always being sent to other lands and regions to engage in diplomatic missions or to act in the service of their liege lords. NPC master ambassadors are often found in foreign courts manipulating the affairs of local nobility or representing a nation&apos;s interests in times of crisis. As the eyes and ears of their rulers, master ambassadors are excellent contacts for adventuring parties seeking to hear news of home." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">
