It can do this whenever it hits with a natural attack or an unarmed attack, but it can also make the transfer by means of a successful melee touch attack or a ranged touch attack, hurling a worm at a foe from a distance of up to 10 feet.\n\nEach worm is a Fine vermin with AC 10 and 1 hit point. It can be killed with normal damage or by the touch of silver. On the spawn&apos;s next action, the worm burrows into its host&apos;s flesh. \n\nA creature with a natural armor bonus of +5 or better is immune to this burrowing effect. The worm makes its way toward the host&apos;s brain, dealing 1 point of damage per round for 1d4+1 rounds. \n\nAt the end of that period, it reaches the brain. While the worm is inside a victim, a remove curse or remove disease effect destroys it, and a dispel evil or neutralize poison effect delays its progress for 10d6 minutes. A successful DC 20 Heal check extracts the worm and kills it.\n\nOnce the worm reaches the brain, it deals 1d2 points of Intelligence damage per round until it either is killed (by remove curse or remove disease) or slays its host (death occurs at o Intelligence). A Small, Medium, or Large creature slain by a worm rises as a new spawn of Kyuss (not a favored spawn) 1d6+4 rounds later; a Tiny or smaller creature quickly putrefies, and a Huge or larger creature becomes a normal zombie of the appropriate size. Newly created spawn are not under the control of their creator, but they usually follow whatever favored spawn of Kyuss created them.\n\nIf a creature is infested with multiple worms, a single remove curse or remove disease destroys all the worms infesting the creature at once.\n\nA favored spawn attacking a helpless opponent may use its foul embrace ability instead of this ability." compset="Special" summary="Once per round as a free action, a favored spawn of Kyuss can transfer a worm from its own body to that of an opponent." uniqueness="unique">
