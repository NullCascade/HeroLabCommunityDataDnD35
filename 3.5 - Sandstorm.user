Such gatherings speak to eons of time, weathering, and history. This power is not visible to the unpracticed eye, but for those with the appropriate sensitivity, even common sand is awash with potential that can be tapped to increase the effects of spells and produce other special effects.\n\n{b}Limitations of Use{/b}: Drift magic requires a connection to the waste, in the form of sand or other desert soil. In waste environments, the soil surrounding a character is sufficient to meet this requirement. When traveling in other environments, a practitioner of drift magic must carry 1 pound of such material among her equipment.\n\n{b}Using Drift Magic{/b}: To use drift magic, a character must merely keep in mind her special knowledge of the desert. No checks are required. In natural areas of sand, dust, or ash, a practitioner can use drift magic as a free action. Other areas require the practitioner to expend a move action to utilize drift magic. Spells with a casting time of longer than 1 standard action cannot benefit from drift magic.\n\n{b}Bonus to Effective Caster Level{/b}: A practitioner of drift magic adds 1 to the effective caster level of any spell that has the earth descriptor or that deals dessication damage. Even if a spell meets both these criteria, the effective caster level only increases by 1.\n\n{b}Flaywind Burst{/b}: Characters with the Drift Magic feat can learn {i}flaywind burst{/i} as a 4th-level spell, instead of a 5th-level one." compset="Feat" summary="In ash/sand area free, otherwise move, +1 CL to earth or dessicating spell." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="rBhuka" name="Bhuka" description="The bhukas are a goblinoid people who claim descent from the first inhabitants of the world. Their culture celebrates and preserves ancestral ways of living.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Although not technologically advanced, bhukas are a sophisticated people with developed art and social organization. They are not warlike, so they avoid conflict via stealth. A bhuka never approaches strangers but observes from hiding as long as possible to gauge thier intent.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: Bhukas are slight (4-5 ft tall and rarely more than 90 lb), with sand-colored skin and brick-red, tightly curled hair. Their large ears, networked with veins, fold flat against the head to retain heat at night and keep out sand. A neck frill has spines that can lift it for cooling. The face of a bhuka is flat, with slit nostrils protected by skinflaps. Bhuka&#146;s have long lashes to keep out dust, and the skin around the eyes is dark, resembling a mask. Their wide feet aid movement over sand. Body paint signifies social position (a simple stripe on a youth&#146;s neck frill to elaborate spotted, striped or whorled patterns on a matriarch). Clothing is woven from desert grasses that protect from heat.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: From the beginning of their history, bhukas have been a gentle people exploited by others. When the first people emerged from the Lower World, bhukas were the last to choose a home and had to adapt to the waste. Cruder goblinoids call them weak, while badland dwarves and painted elves are often friendly. Warlike races drove bhukas away from fertile lands, yet they take pride in flourishing in the waste. They aren&apos;t cowards&#151;push too hard, and they reveal a toughness bred of harsh living. They have trade relations with crucians but the asheratis&#146; presence below the sand challenges a bhuka&#146;s perception of reality and standing in the waste heirarchy.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: A complex system of relationships hold bhuka villages together. Respect for superiors and contribution to the common good is drilled into all members of society, and those who will not become outcasts. Bhuka society is lawful, with most tending toward good.\n\n{b}Bhuka Lands{/b}: Bhukas form extended groups of several related clans, called phratries. Each claims ancestry from one couple who emerged from the Lower World in the beginning and must maintain a particular tradition of the people. Bhukas inhabit adobe or sandstone dwellings built into and against cliffs or dug into the upper levels of desert canyons. The entrance to a house is well above ground level for defense&#151;access is by ladders or rope lifts. A central spring provides water to the community.\n\nFarms use traditional dry-farming techniques to grow their staple foods of beans, sunflowers, desert grasses, and corn. \n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Each phratry is responsible for protecting a relic of the Emergence, the time when the first people came out from under the earth. For example, members of the Wokuhoo (Moon Owl) phratry are the caretakers of the Talon, a relic of the bird that led their ancestors into the Upper World. \n\nVillages are headed by a Grandmother who presides over a council of male and female elders. The Lower World from which they came is called Second Womb, where Kikanuti nurtured and taught them until they were ready to emerge. Their savage cousins are immature and must stay underground. Grandmother is the link to Kikanuti and presides over ceremonies where clan elders don ritual masks to dance.\n\n{b}Language{/b}: All Bhuka lore is oral, supplemented by a rich library of symbols that adorn both artistic and everyday objects. Their tongue is related to Goblin, but has diverged enough to be incomprehensible to other goblins.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: Bhuka names carry meaning, but retain harsh Goblin syllables. Most have a given name, mother&#146;s clan (prefix {i}kha{/i}, &#147;born of&#148;), and marriage clan (prefix {i}gi{/i}). Children have pet names until they choose an adult name.\n\n{b}Male Given Names{/b}: Aghila&#146;ak (Runs Like Lizard), Cochik&#146;ukan (Eyes of Sunhawk), Kotigana (Ears of Hare), Niskigan (Snake Fang).\n\n{b}Female Given Names{/b}: Chinkichu (Basket of Corn), Hintak&#146;inai (Painted Frill), Kekkoti (Little Ear), Lakinigo (Slow Smile).\n\n{b}Clan Names{/b}: Clans are named for a totem spirit or relic. Chikuk (Sunhawk), Kekkinna (Ear of Corn), Kichu (Basket), Wiki&#146;i (Swallow).\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Bhuka&apos;s tight-knit community seldom produces wanderers, but ancient migrations remain part of racial memory. Some born with wind in their souls carry messages and gifts to scattered villages or lead trade expeditions to crucian lands. Those in whom the wind blows strongest go to see where the other children of Kikanuti went, or just follow their hearts. \n\nOutcast bhukas (usually bitter, selfish beings) also rove the waste. Some yearn to belong and may find a sense of community among other races." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rAsherat" name="Asherati" description="   An asherati might be mistaken for a thin human under some circumstances&#151;at least until the asherati&apos;s rust-red skin begins to glow with a light all its own, or until he dives headlong into the nearest sand dune, disappearing without a trace.\n   Asheratis are a geographically established people who live below the sands and dusts of suitable wastelands, rising to the surface to hunt for food, socialize and trade with other races, and make war upon their enemies. As merfolk are to the sea, asheratis are to the sands.\n\n{b}Personality{/b}: Asheratis are a quiet people, given to refl ection and long retreats from the presence of their fellows. However, every asherati acknowledges the value of community and fellowship, and each retreat is followed by a return to a sand-shrouded village where friendships are renewed and the needs of the community are met.\n\n{b}Physical Description{/b}: An asherati appears as a humanoid with smooth skin the color of rust. An asherati can make its skin glow as if with an inner fire, giving off a piercing illumination that suffuses through sand. An asherati has no body hair and eyes the color of ivory. The lithe asherati is a graceful swimmer of the dunes, and thus eschews excessive clothing or equipment, wearing only minimal, skin-hugging garments for modesty&apos;s sake. Some asheratis wear tight leather armor, streamlined so as not to hinder their progress through the sands. A typical asherati stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds.\n\n{b}Relations{/b}: Asheratis delight when nomads, caravans, or travelers of almost any race appear in the sands above their homes&#151;by day, asherati merchant trade their wares, while at night, asherati rogues silently ascend and try their hands at pilfering. Trade continues despite this behavior, because no one can come close to replicating the delicate asherati sand sculptures (see Sandstorm p. 101), which can fetch large prices in cities far from the desert.\n   Asheratis tolerate other established races of the wastes, grudgingly admitting that each has found a niche. The asheratis live below the sand and the other races above. Still, sometimes confl ict erupts or potential feuds smolder just below the surface.\n   It is not unknown for caravans moving through the desert to hire an asherati or two to act as guides and scouts. Especially adventurous asheratis have left the wastes entirely, seeking their fortunes in completely alien lands.\n\n{b}Alignment{/b}: Asheratis share a common concern for one another&#146;s welfare and are, therefore, good. Observing no specific rules when it comes to behavior, and having a proclivity toward thievery, asheratis are usually chaotic.\n\n{b}Asherati Lands{/b}: The trackless, changing waste seems an inhospitable location to claim, with the burning sun by day and frigid cold at night. That&#146;s why asheratis claim the lands below, living beneath the sand as if it were water. Under the cover of sand are their homes, communities, and even a few great cities of striking architecture. The interior of every buried building is hollow; the air is clear, and asheratis live in a way not unlike that of common humans. Cleverly constructed &#147;sandlocks&#148; in the floors of their homes allow asheratis to move into and out of buried buildings without disrupting the equilibrium between sand and open space.\n   In asherati cities, families hold the power. Powerful, wealthy, and well-respected families are responsible for the outlook of the local populace, and are referred to as the First Families. The First Families share power in a council, and truly great families are sometimes important in more than one village. Since family is such an important aspect of asherati social life, bad behavior on the part of a single family is often tolerated for far longer than in most other civilizations.\n   Far-flung asherati towns are usually made up of just two or three families, all working together to build their community. Usually such colonies are built to expand trade. Others are secretly established in sandy areas that abut more temperate regions to serve as a base for larceny.\n\n{b}Religion{/b}: Many asheratis give homage to Solanil (see Sandstorm p. 46), whom they view as responsible for building the first sand city to shelter the asheratis when they arrived in the wasteland. Particularly zealous asherati worshippers see themselves as the &#147;seeds&#148; that the deity has planted, just as she encourages the planting of seeds so there will be more food in the waste.\n\n{b}Names{/b}: Asheratis have given names and family names.\n   {i}Male Names{/i}: Amhapar, Het, Iputhut, Iu-same, Khankhe, Menefer, M&#146;ut, Nament, Tauah.\n   {i}Female Names{/i}: Abesukh, Aned, Ankheru, Djede, Kher-ra, Nemenmo, Reht, Shis.\n   {i}Family Names{/i}: Ambera, Atinani, Faihayl, Habah, Huridah, Imtimah, Manah, Nadeeha, Najeema, Nazihar, Nimah, Rawthay, Reedayl.\n\n{b}Adventurers{/b}: Every asherati has some measure of adventurous spirit, no matter how deeply hidden. It would be hard to name an asherati who did not try his hand at a minor bit of thievery for the fun and excitement such behavior promises. It is not unheard of to find full-time asherati adventurers, though such folk usually leave the sands of their birth far behind, finding noble quests in the far corners of the world." compset="Race">

Creatures of the earth subtype can move only 10 feet per round slower in molten glass.\n\nIf a creature is only partially in the area (such as a Large or larger creature on the edge of the effect), it still takes full damage, but its speed is reduced only by half (instead of to 5 feet).\n\nA creature caught in molten glass takes 10d6 points of fire damage on the first round. The transmuted material cools over a period of 10 rounds. Each round, the number of dice of damage the cooling glass deals is reduced by one, until it deals no damage.\n\nThe glass is solid enough to trap creatures by the sixth round. Creatures unable to escape the glass before it hardens become trapped and must be broken out. A creature so caught can break free by making a Strength check to break the glass or by dealing damage to the glass. Glass has hardness 1, 1 hit point per inch of thickness, and a break DC of 12, + 1 per inch of thickness. A creature partially caught in the glass takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, a -4 penalty to Dexterity, and is unable to move. When breaking glass, a creature takes 1d6 points of damage each time it makes a successful Strength check to break free. If broken free by others, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage from broken glass. A creature trapped beneath the surface of the glass might begin to suffocate (see page 304 of the Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide)." compset="Spell" summary="Melts sand into glass.">

The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while subject to sand in the hourglass, nor does it age. Shattering the hourglass before the spell ends slays the bound creature, and its body remains sand (effectively destroyed). The duration is one year per caster level, after which time the victim reforms into its original shape, destroying the hourglass.  Reduce the save DC by 4.\n\nWind in the Waste: The subject is transformed into a howling wind blowing across the waste. The victim retains knowledge of its prior existence, but has no abilities other than to howl with the wind. Because of its insubstantial nature, the subject is nearly impossible to define or specifically locate. The DM might allow the victim to be found through special means or through powerful magic (such as limited wish).

The {i}awakened{/i} sand is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with sand you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavours if you communicate your desire to it.\n\nThe sand creature you awaken has the same statistics as a Huge animated object with a base land speed of 40 feet and a burrow speed of 20 feet. Unlike normal animated objects, {i}awakened{/i} sand beings have the earth subtype, and their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. A sand being has immunity to polymorphing. The awakened sand can speak one language you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any) it has.\n\nA sand creature can engulf Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The sand creature merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent&apos;s choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed opponents are considered grappled and are trapped within the sand creature&apos;s body. The sand creature deals 1d6+3 points of damage to trapped opponents each round after the one in which it engulfed them. Opponents that need to breathe risk suffocation (see page 304 of the {i}Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide{/i}). The save DC is Strength-based.\n\nSand creatures are amorphous and can do anything sand would be expected to do&#151;hide perfectly atop other sand, form into dunes and drifts, and pour through small openings (although passing through an opening two size categories smaller than the creature takes a full-round action).\n\n{i}XP Cost{/i}: 500 XP." compset="Spell" summary="A region of sand forms into a Huge, sentient creature.">

  <thing id="gOleum" name="Oleum (flask)" description="A black liquid, oleum has a foul, bitter odor. It occurs naturally around the world, but is particularly common in the waste. Though it forms underground, oleum is generally found in surface pools in areas of barren waste terrain.\n   You can use a flask of oleum as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist&#146;s fire (page 128 of the Player&#146;s Handbook), except that it takes a full-round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully. Burning oleum is hard to put out, granting a &#150;4 penalty on the Reflex save to extinguish the fire. The oleum burns away within 4 rounds (eliminating the penalty on putting out the fire).\n   Raw oleum burns readily, but it is smoky when it does so. The smoke created by burning oleum is heavy smoke (see Smoke, page 304 of the Dungeon Master&#146;s Guide), so a wide area of open air is required for the substance to burn safely. Every round when raw oleum burns, it produces enough smoke to fill a 5-foot cube. For this reason, oleum is typically used only in lamps made to burn outdoors. The smoke drives away flying insects.\n   Oleum is also used to lubricate moving parts; a flask of it can cover a 5-foot square, provided that the surface is smooth. A creature can walk within or through an area of oleum at half normal speed by making a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can&#146;t move that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Balance skill description, page 67 of the Player&#146;s Handbook, for details). If an area of oleum is ignited, it burns for 4 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. A quart of oleum (two flasks) can coat a Medium creature, providing a +4 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and opposed grapple checks made to resist being grappled or to escape a pin. Oleum applied in this manner also acts as insect repellent, protecting you from normal vermin (such as those summoned by insect plague) and granting a +4 bonus to Armor Class against vermin. A creature with oleum on its hands takes a &#150;4 penalty on grapple checks or any task requiring a solid grip, including attack rolls with weapons. A roll of 1 on the attack means the oleum-coated creature drops the slippery weapon.\n   When worn, oleum is uncomfortable and unpleasant. You take a &#150;2 penalty on Fortitude saves against natural heat effects. Further, oleum makes you quite flammable, granting a &#150;4 penalty on saves against supernaturally hot effects and any attack involving fire, including Reflex saves to put yourself out after catching fire. When subjected to a fire-based attack that does not normally cause subjects to catch on fire, you must make a DC 14 Reflex save or catch on fire. As indicated above, oleum burns away after 4 rounds.\n   An ounce of oleum can substitute for the material component usually used for a grease spell." compset="Gear" summary="See text.">

The new object is made of sand, but serves as a normal item of the same sort. A shapesand hammer functions just like an ordinary hammer, and a shapesand waterskin is just as watertight as an ordinary skin.\n   Controlling shapesand is an exercise in willpower. A DC 16 Wisdom check establishes control of a volume of sand based on the shaper&#146;s Wisdom score:\n{b}Wisdom Score | Controllable Volume{/b}\n1&#150;3 {b}|{/b} None\n4&#150;7 {b}|{/b} 1-ft. cube\n8&#150;11 {b}|{/b} 2-1/2-ft. cube\n12&#150;15 {b}|{/b} 5-ft. cube\n16&#150;19 {b}|{/b} 7-1/2-ft. cube\n20&#150;23 {b}|{/b} 10-ft. cube\n24+ {b}|{/b} +2-1/2 ft per 4 points of Wisdom\n\nIf your Wisdom check succeeds, you can reshape the volume of sand as you desire. Once control is established, the shape lasts as long as you remain within 100 feet of it. Thus, those with suffi cient patience and strong enough will can construct small fortresses out of shapesand, even if they must do so a few cubic feet at a time.\n   Another character can wrest control of a shapesand item away from you by succeeding on an opposed Wisdom check, though the winner&#146;s Wisdom score must be high enough to shape an item the size of the one contested. For example, if two characters are attempting to control a 5-foot cube of shapesand, the challenger must not only beat his opponent&#146;s roll, but must also have a Wisdom score of at least 12.\n   If you are a sand shaper (new prestige class, see Sandstorm p. 76) or a cleric with the Sand domain (p. 107) using shapesand in conjunction with your sand shaping abilities, you do not count shapesand items against the total number of items you can maintain at one time. In addition, if you are a sand shaper, you can give control of shapesand objects to other individuals, and those items persist even if the new owner takes them outside the normal 100-foot control area. The new owner need not make a Wisdom check to establish control of the item, so long as his Wisdom score meets the minimum requirement for the object&#146;s volume.\n\nCraft (Alchemy) DC: 25" compset="Gear">
